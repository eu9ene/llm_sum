       "{'article': '(CNN)The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday, a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague, in the Netherlands, where the court is based. The Palestinians signed the ICC\\'s founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed \"in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014.\" Later that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians\\' efforts to join the body. But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, speaking at Wednesday\\'s ceremony, said it was a move toward greater justice. \"As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice,\" he said, according to an ICC news release. \"Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace.\" Judge Kuniko Ozaki, a vice president of the ICC, said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians. \"As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine, Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute. These are substantive commitments, which cannot be taken lightly,\" she said. Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development. \"Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure, and countries that support universal acceptance of the court\\'s treaty should speak out to welcome its membership,\" said Balkees Jarrah, international justice counsel for the group. \"What\\'s objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice, not Palestine\\'s decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members.\" In January, when the preliminary ICC examination was opened, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage, saying the court was overstepping its boundaries. The United States also said it \"strongly\" disagreed with the court\\'s decision. \"As we have said repeatedly, we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC,\" the State Department said in a statement. It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations. \"We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace,\" it said. But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as \"Palestine.\" While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation, it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would \"conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality.\" The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead. The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June. The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. CNN\\'s Vasco Cotovio, Kareem Khadder and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.',\n",

       " 'text': 'I visited Saudi Arabia in September 2008, arriving in Riyadh the day Hurricane Ike smashed into Houston, knocking out power for my wife and two little boys. Nothing I could do about it but watch storm footage on CNN International while drinking non-alcoholic Budweiser (no booze in the kingdom) and listening to the sounds of the muzzein calling Muslims to worship at the mosque behind the Marriott.\\n\\nThat was the same month that the financial crisis hit, and on the day of Lehman Brothers\\' ( LEHMQ - news - people ) collapse I spent the evening with billionaire Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal at his camp in the desert outside of Riyadh. We sat in the open air, under a starry sky, on an expanse of Persian rugs that must have taken up a quarter-acre. He was attended by a cadre of Bedouin servants who wore little pistols in their belts and continually refilled our little china cups with strong yellow Arabian coffee. A news junkie, the prince had three mega-screen TVs set up across the island of rugs from us. The biggest one in the middle was tuned to CNBC. The others showed pilgrims in Mecca walking around the Kaaba. It was the holy month of Ramadan. As we watched coverage of the financial collapse, Al-Waleed had the awesome idea of text-messaging CNBC\\'s Maria Bartaromo his thoughts on Lehman. I think he was doing it mostly to show off that he had Maria\\'s number in his phone, and I was impressed when she responded to his text 10 minutes later and asked him to be on her show the next day.\\n\\nLater in the evening I watched in disbelief as a line of about 500 Saudi men formed in the darkness, and one by one the men came forward to pay homage to the prince and ask him for some form of charity (money for a car, tuition, dowry, debts, etc). Several young men recited poems to the prince, who all the while continued to watch TV or check his phone. He holds court like this every week, giving away millions in patronage each year. The prince spends a lot of time in the desert and says he doesn\\'t go to sleep until he sees the sky begin to brighten with dawn.\\n\\nA couple days later I found myself in the desert again, this time in the white-leather backseat of a 10-year-old Crown Victoria being driven the four hours from Riyadh to Damman, where I was to tour the headquarters of oil company Saudi Aramco. During Ramadan Saudis are barred from eating or drinking anything from sunup to sundown. But there was no prohibition on rock and roll; the driver, without comment, popped a cassette tape of Aerosmith\\'s greatest hits into the stereo, and we screamed over the pristine blacktop at 90 miles an hour. Finally, when the red ball dipped under the desert horizon, my driver pulled into a truckstop (which, other than oilfield flares and a few camels, was the only sign of life in the desert) and bought us some snacks and water. I had been abstaining from food during the day as well, in part to see how the Saudis did it, and also because there was none for sale until nightfall. A few minutes later the driver pulled off the road to pray. I sat in the parked car and ate the most delicious bag of chips ever, all the while marveling that Aerosmith\\'s \"Crazy\" was a much better song than I ever remembered. The full moon rose orange.\\n\\nRead more \"glimpses\" in our On The Road special report.',\n",

The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating.\\nPolice warned that anyone using Mr Charles\\'s death \"as an excuse to commit crime\" would be \"dealt with robustly\".\\nAppealing for calm, family spokesman Stafford Scott said: \"We understand your frustration, we understand your anger - don\\'t feel that the family doesn\\'t feel the anger and the frustration too.\\n\"But what the family knows is taking it to the streets doesn\\'t give you justice.\\n\"Burning down your own homes, burning down your neighbourhood is not going to give you justice.\"\\nMr Scott, who runs race advocacy group Tottenham Rights, said black people had historically found it difficult \"to win the hearts and minds of people\".\\n\"We get no empathy, we get no sympathy. But this case is different - for once we\\'ve got the evidence.\\n\"For once we\\'re not relying on the IPCC or the police to gather the evidence. The world has seen it and will feel it if we don\\'t get justice.\"\\nHe added the family needed to \"fight this properly\" and had sought the best legal support.\\nMr Scott said the family asked the community \"to support them in their struggle, to be dignified when they expect us to be wild\".\\nHackney North and Stoke Newington MP Diane Abbott told the protest she supported Mr Charles\\'s parents and would not rest until questions were answered.\\nIn an earlier statement, the shadow home secretary said: \"The anger and upset at the death of Rashan Charles is understandable.\\n\"But Rashan\\'s family have explicitly spoken out against hostile actions. We must respect their wishes and any protests must be peaceful.\"\\nThe anger of the protesters is clear. Many chanted \"Justice for Rashan\", clutching pictures of him along with their placards.\\nSome confronted the police officers there to keep an eye on the demonstration, demanding answers.\\nThere were none forthcoming. That\\'s because the investigation is now in the hands of the Independent Police Complaints Commission. It will be their job to determine exactly what happened.\\nSome campaigners, though, say there are too many of these investigations, too many lives being lost.\\nThey feel that their voices are too often not heard. There was much talk of the CCTV footage that captured the moment Rashan Charles was restrained.\\nThat has been pored over frame by frame, with many different interpretations of what happened, and many questions raised by it.\\nDespite the anger, the vigil passed off peacefully, but the campaigners say they will not be silenced. They left though with the words of the family ringing in their ears: \"We want peace on the streets.\"\\nOn Friday evening, demonstrators blocked part of Kingsland Road.\\nAt one point protesters, some wearing masks, jumped on to a lorry and clung to the wing mirrors as it drove through the barricade.\\nScores of missiles were later launched at police as they attempted to disperse the group.\\nPolice in Hackney tweeted: \"Officers have been subjected to abuse and violence. Whatever the frustrations, this is patently not what the family of Rashan Charles wanted.\"\\nThe Met Police has since said that the violence that erupted on Friday night was \"separate\" from a peaceful protest that was held earlier in the day.\\nDet Supt Claire Crawley said: \"Thankfully nobody was seriously injured, but there was inconvenience to local residents and road users and damage caused to vehicles, a cash machine and a number of windows.\\n\"We will always support the right to lawful protest but behaviour such as that seen last night cannot be tolerated.\"',\n",

       "{'text': 'Johannesburg (CNN)He checked the series of stills on his camera. It was then that photographer James Oatway realized the entire attack had taken less than two minutes. It was the morning after a night of unrest in Johannesburg\\'s Alexandra Township that saw foreign-owned shops looted and destroyed. Mozambican Emmanuel Sithole was walking down a street when four South Africans surrounded him. Sithole pleaded for mercy, but it was already too late. The attackers bludgeoned him with a wrench, stabbed him with knives, all in broad daylight. And Oatway had captured it all on his camera. \"They looked like hardened thugs, just by their intensity, the way they moved, the expressions on their faces,\" Oatway told CNN. \"They wanted one thing and that was to kill Emmanuel. They wanted his blood and nothing was going to stop them from doing that.\" Oatway says he tried to get as close as possible, conscious that the attackers were aware of his presence. \"When the attack started I was 20 meters (65 feet) away, but at one point I was 4 or 5 meters away,\" he said. \"I did think that maybe they would leave him alone.\" The attackers finally did move on and leave Sithole alone. Oatway and his fellow journalist Beauregard Tromp quickly put the injured man in the back of the car and rushed him to a hospital, where he later died. \"I still remember him looking straight into my eyes,\" said Oatway. \"He had a kind of a dazed, shocked look in his face.\" Oatway\\'s series of images of the ordeal landed on the front page of South Africa\\'s Sunday Times under the headline, \"Kill thy neighbor: Alex attack brings home SA\\'s shame.\" It\\'s a shame that South Africa continues to confront. Seven people have been killed in the latest round of xenophobic violence against poorer immigrants, many from South Africa\\'s neighbors. Xenophobic attacks: How did we get here? Local media alleged that the attacks were a consequence of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini reportedly saying at a recent gathering that foreigners \"should pack their bags and go\" because they are taking jobs from citizens. Shortly after his reported comments, violence against immigrants erupted in the port city of Durban. But on Monday, Zwelithini said he had not called for a war on immigrants. \"This war I am calling for today is to protect everyone of foreign origin in this country irrespective of which country they are from.\" The United Nations said the attacks actually began in March after a labor dispute between citizens and foreign workers. OPINION: Labeling South Africa violence as xenophobia misses the point . But it was Oatway\\'s photos of the violent attack on Sithole that have seemingly encapsulated the true horror of the situation -- and South Africa\\'s leaders have begun to take notice. \"Terrible picture. People who live in rough townships have never seen such a scene,\" said President Jacob Zuma about the photos in a televised news conference. \"And I was sitting and I was saying to myself, what are we telling the world about ourselves?\" Police announced they\\'ve now arrested all four suspects -- the last caught overnight Tuesday -- with help from Oatway\\'s photos, which is little solace for the photographer who captured a level of depravity rarely seen. \"I\\'m sickened by it,\" said Oatway. \"And I\\'m extremely angry, angry with the men that did this, and ultimately I\\'m upset that our efforts weren\\'t successful in saving Emmanuel\\'s life.\"',\n",

       "{'text': 'The cause was complications of pneumonia, his daughter Elizabeth Cahill Tiedemann said.\\n\\nDr. Cahill and generations of researchers he trained “wrote a lot of what have become the textbooks of physiology,” explaining glucose and protein metabolism both in normal health and in diabetes, said Dr. C. Ronald Kahn, the chief academic officer at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, where Dr. Cahill was research director from 1962 to 1978.\\n\\nAmong his research subjects were divinity students who were paid $300 to fast for a week and hibernating bears. Some of his most important research, in the 1960s, involved tracking the blood chemistry of people who were trying out an experimental treatment for severe obesity: total starvation, for up to six weeks, in the hospital.\\n\\nA crucial finding was that in the first few days without food, the liver starts breaking down protein to make glucose to feed the brain. But using protein as fuel can be perilous, because it is the stuff of vital organs and muscle.\\n\\nBut people do survive weeks of starvation. Dr. Cahill’s study helped explain why. After about a week, the body makes another shift, and instead of cannibalizing its own proteins it starts breaking down fat into substances called ketones, which can feed the brain in place of glucose. A natural drop in insulin is what drives the shift to ketones, Dr. Cahill determined.\\n\\nThe studies transformed scientists’ understanding of starvation and the way insulin regulates metabolism, said Dr. Joseph Avruch, a professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School.\\n\\nOn a practical level, the findings helped establish the importance of dietary protein to prevent organ damage in people who are on very low-calorie diets or who are ill or injured and not able to eat normally, said Dr. Rudolph Leibel, co-director of the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center at Columbia University Medical Center.\\n\\nIn addition, Dr. Kahn said, Dr. Cahill helped the military formulate high-energy bars for emergency rations.\\n\\nIn 1982 and 1985, Dr. Cahill was called as an expert witness for the prosecution in the two trials of Mr. von Bülow for the attempted murder of his wife, Martha (also known as Sunny). Mrs. von Bülow was in a deep coma, possibly caused by extremely low blood sugar. Her husband was accused of trying to kill her with insulin, which lowers blood sugar.\\n\\nDr. Cahill reviewed more than two years of her medical records and testified at the first trial that her coma, and a prior one from which she had recovered, were caused by insulin. The insulin level in her blood, he told the court, was “out of the ballpark.”\\n\\nIn the first trial, Mr. von Bülow was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in prison. He appealed, the conviction was overturned, and he was tried again.\\n\\nAt the second trial, Dr. Cahill showed up with a pocket full of sugar cubes, which he lined up on the witness stand to help explain his points. He testified that insulin was the only plausible explanation for Mrs. von Bülow’s coma, but the defense lawyer challenged him repeatedly.\\n\\nFinally, Dr. Cahill said, “It is so difficult for me to answer inane questions.”\\n\\nMr. von Bülow was acquitted at the second trial.\\n\\nDr. Cahill was disappointed, Dr. Kahn said, adding, “I think he felt justice had not been done.”\\n\\nMrs. von Bülow died in 2008, at 76, after nearly 28 years in a coma.\\n\\nGeorge Francis Cahill Jr. was born in Manhattan on July 7, 1927. His father was a urologic surgeon at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons. George Jr. attended the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn., and entered Yale at 16.\\n\\nAt 17 he enlisted in the Navy as a pharmacist’s mate and was scheduled to take part in the invasion of Japan, but the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki changed that.\\n\\nAfter the war he finished college at Yale, and in 1953 he graduated from medical school at Columbia.\\n\\nHe went on to become a professor of medicine at Harvard, and taught there until retiring in 1990. From 1958 until 1978 he also did research at the Joslin center, and from 1962 until 1990 he was a researcher and administrator for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which supports medical research.\\n\\nBesides Ms. Tiedemann, Dr. Cahill is survived by three other daughters, Colleen Cahill Remley, Sarah Rhett Cahill and Eva Wagner Cahill; two sons, Peter duPont Cahill and George F. Cahill III; and 15 grandchildren. His wife of 60 years, the former Sarah duPont, died in 2010.\\n\\nIn an online article, Dr. Kahn called Dr. Cahill a “consummate teacher” and said that when he retired from medicine he began teaching a biology course for nonscientists at Dartmouth College that was an overnight success.\\n\\nWithin days of Dr. Cahill’s first lecture, the class had to be moved from a room that held 100 to an auditorium that seated more than 400.',\n",

      "{'text': 'Johannesburg (CNN)He checked the series of stills on his camera. It was then that photographer James Oatway realized the entire attack had taken less than two minutes. It was the morning after a night of unrest in Johannesburg\\'s Alexandra Township that saw foreign-owned shops looted and destroyed. Mozambican Emmanuel Sithole was walking down a street when four South Africans surrounded him. Sithole pleaded for mercy, but it was already too late. The attackers bludgeoned him with a wrench, stabbed him with knives, all in broad daylight. And Oatway had captured it all on his camera. \"They looked like hardened thugs, just by their intensity, the way they moved, the expressions on their faces,\" Oatway told CNN. \"They wanted one thing and that was to kill Emmanuel. They wanted his blood and nothing was going to stop them from doing that.\" Oatway says he tried to get as close as possible, conscious that the attackers were aware of his presence. \"When the attack started I was 20 meters (65 feet) away, but at one point I was 4 or 5 meters away,\" he said. \"I did think that maybe they would leave him alone.\" The attackers finally did move on and leave Sithole alone. Oatway and his fellow journalist Beauregard Tromp quickly put the injured man in the back of the car and rushed him to a hospital, where he later died. \"I still remember him looking straight into my eyes,\" said Oatway. \"He had a kind of a dazed, shocked look in his face.\" Oatway\\'s series of images of the ordeal landed on the front page of South Africa\\'s Sunday Times under the headline, \"Kill thy neighbor: Alex attack brings home SA\\'s shame.\" It\\'s a shame that South Africa continues to confront. Seven people have been killed in the latest round of xenophobic violence against poorer immigrants, many from South Africa\\'s neighbors. Xenophobic attacks: How did we get here? Local media alleged that the attacks were a consequence of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini reportedly saying at a recent gathering that foreigners \"should pack their bags and go\" because they are taking jobs from citizens. Shortly after his reported comments, violence against immigrants erupted in the port city of Durban. But on Monday, Zwelithini said he had not called for a war on immigrants. \"This war I am calling for today is to protect everyone of foreign origin in this country irrespective of which country they are from.\" The United Nations said the attacks actually began in March after a labor dispute between citizens and foreign workers. OPINION: Labeling South Africa violence as xenophobia misses the point. But it was Oatway\\'s photos of the violent attack on Sithole that have seemingly encapsulated the true horror of the situation -- and South Africa\\'s leaders have begun to take notice. \"Terrible picture. People who live in rough townships have never seen such a scene,\" said President Jacob Zuma about the photos in a televised news conference. \"And I was sitting and I was saying to myself, what are we telling the world about ourselves?\" Police announced they\\'ve now arrested all four suspects -- the last caught overnight Tuesday -- with help from Oatway\\'s photos, which is little solace for the photographer who captured a level of depravity rarely seen. \"I\\'m sickened by it,\" said Oatway. \"And I\\'m extremely angry, angry with the men that did this, and ultimately I\\'m upset that our efforts weren\\'t successful in saving Emmanuel\\'s life.\"', 'summary': \"Photographer James Oatway captured a violent attack that resulted in death of a Mozambican in South Africa. Seven people have been killed in recent violence against poorer immigrants, many from South Africa's neighbors.\"}\n"

       "{'text': \"Tulip has been covering the outbreak over the past few months, reporting on the children born with microcephaly and other birth defects believed to be caused by the virus as well as speaking to scientists who are leading the fight back against Zika. Many of you got in touch on Facebook to ask Tulip questions about the new vaccine, and when it might be available to pregnant women. This is an edited version of the Facebook Q&A. Question from Dawn McLean: Have you tested the vaccine already? How do you know if it works or not? Tulip answers: Human trials haven't started for the vaccine being developed by the National Institutes of Health - where I have been reporting from this week. They are due to start - assuming no major problems - in the summer/ autumn of this year. If the vaccine is found to be safe with no concerning side effects, the drug will be given to a larger number of people to test how effective it is and further evaluate its safety. The final phase is giving it to large groups of people to confirm how effective it is. Question from Priscilla Wakanuma: How possible is it to make a vaccine for this virus? Tulip replies: Scientists here in Bethesda at the National Institutes of Health think it's very possible. They already have a vaccine for a similar virus - West Nile - which they have been working on. So they're using some of the tried and tested methods from that to try and develop a vaccine for Zika ASAP. Taj Rahman asks: The vaccine is available in November, I thought this was a global emergency? Tulip replies: Hi Taj - getting vaccines ready for market takes years, often decades. They have to go through stringent safety and efficacy trials and then get signed off by a whole load of regulatory bodies. When the WHO declared this public health emergency last month, one of the key things they highlighted was the urgent need for research into new vaccines. Scientists and pharmaceuticals came together very fast on Ebola, it's hoped that can happen again this time. But sadly, many more babies are expected to be born with these birth defects in the meantime. Question from Hannah Borrett: How have they managed to push through the development so quickly? Tulip replies: You're right, it can take years, decades even to get a new vaccine through all the clinical trials and then signed off through all the various national and international regulatory authorities. But in an emergency - which the Zika outbreak now is - things can be fast-tracked. A lot more money is put into research, and there's a much bigger political will to get things moving fast. Take the Ebola outbreak for example, there are now a couple of candidate vaccines that could be used in an outbreak that have shown some efficacy. Research - and cash - for that vaccine was pushed through super quickly. Adebola Misturah Martins-Bello asks about plans to prioritise who will be considered a priority for the vaccine. Tulip replies: The plan here at the National Institutes of Health is to have a special focus on protecting pregnant women. The virus isn't particularly harmful for most people, but the concern is this strongly suspected link to babies of infected mothers being born with under developed brains. If a link if confirmed, and a vaccine is developed quickly - health authorities will look into whether to add it to childhood vaccines, a bit like the rubella vaccine, which also protects girls/ women if they have babies later in life.

       "{'text': 'The cause was complications of pneumonia, his daughter Elizabeth Cahill Tiedemann said. Dr. Cahill and generations of researchers he trained “wrote a lot of what have become the textbooks of physiology,” explaining glucose and protein metabolism both in normal health and in diabetes, said Dr. C. Ronald Kahn, the chief academic officer at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, where Dr. Cahill was research director from 1962 to 1978. Among his research subjects were divinity students who were paid $300 to fast for a week and hibernating bears. Some of his most important research, in the 1960s, involved tracking the blood chemistry of people who were trying out an experimental treatment for severe obesity: total starvation, for up to six weeks, in the hospital. A crucial finding was that in the first few days without food, the liver starts breaking down protein to make glucose to feed the brain. But using protein as fuel can be perilous, because it is the stuff of vital organs and muscle. But people do survive weeks of starvation. Dr. Cahill’s study helped explain why. After about a week, the body makes another shift, and instead of cannibalizing its own proteins it starts breaking down fat into substances called ketones, which can feed the brain in place of glucose. A natural drop in insulin is what drives the shift to ketones, Dr. Cahill determined. The studies transformed scientists’ understanding of starvation and the way insulin regulates metabolism, said Dr. Joseph Avruch, a professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School. On a practical level, the findings helped establish the importance of dietary protein to prevent organ damage in people who are on very low-calorie diets or who are ill or injured and not able to eat normally, said Dr. Rudolph Leibel, co-director of the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center at Columbia University Medical Center. In addition, Dr. Kahn said, Dr. Cahill helped the military formulate high-energy bars for emergency rations. In 1982 and 1985, Dr. Cahill was called as an expert witness for the prosecution in the two trials of Mr. von Bülow for the attempted murder of his wife, Martha (also known as Sunny). Mrs. von Bülow was in a deep coma, possibly caused by extremely low blood sugar. Her husband was accused of trying to kill her with insulin, which lowers blood sugar. Dr. Cahill reviewed more than two years of her medical records and testified at the first trial that her coma, and a prior one from which she had recovered, were caused by insulin. The insulin level in her blood, he told the court, was “out of the ballpark.” In the first trial, Mr. von Bülow was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in prison. He appealed, the conviction was overturned, and he was tried again. At the second trial, Dr. Cahill showed up with a pocket full of sugar cubes, which he lined up on the witness stand to help explain his points. He testified that insulin was the only plausible explanation for Mrs. von Bülow’s coma, but the defense lawyer challenged him repeatedly. Finally, Dr. Cahill said, “It is so difficult for me to answer inane questions.” Mr. von Bülow was acquitted at the second trial. Dr. Cahill was disappointed, Dr. Kahn said, adding, “I think he felt justice had not been done.” Mrs. von Bülow died in 2008, at 76, after nearly 28 years in a coma. George Francis Cahill Jr. was born in Manhattan on July 7, 1927. His father was a urologic surgeon at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons. George Jr. attended the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn., and entered Yale at 16. At 17 he enlisted in the Navy as a pharmacist’s mate and was scheduled to take part in the invasion of Japan, but the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki changed that. After the war he finished college at Yale, and in 1953 he graduated from medical school at Columbia. He went on to become a professor of medicine at Harvard, and taught there until retiring in 1990. From 1958 until 1978 he also did research at the Joslin center, and from 1962 until 1990 he was a researcher and administrator for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which supports medical research. Besides Ms. Tiedemann, Dr. Cahill is survived by three other daughters, Colleen Cahill Remley, Sarah Rhett Cahill and Eva Wagner Cahill; two sons, Peter duPont Cahill and George F. Cahill III; and 15 grandchildren. His wife of 60 years, the former Sarah duPont, died in 2010. In an online article, Dr. Kahn called Dr. Cahill a “consummate teacher” and said that when he retired from medicine he began teaching a biology course for nonscientists at Dartmouth College that was an overnight success. Within days of Dr. Cahill’s first lecture, the class had to be moved from a room that held 100 to an auditorium that seated more than 400.',\n",
