[{"text": "The cause was complications of pneumonia, his daughter Elizabeth Cahill Tiedemann said. Dr. Cahill and generations of researchers he trained \u201cwrote a lot of what have become the textbooks of physiology,\u201d explaining glucose and protein metabolism both in normal health and in diabetes, said Dr. C. Ronald Kahn, the chief academic officer at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, where Dr. Cahill was research director from 1962 to 1978. Among his research subjects were divinity students who were paid $300 to fast for a week and hibernating bears. Some of his most important research, in the 1960s, involved tracking the blood chemistry of people who were trying out an experimental treatment for severe obesity: total starvation, for up to six weeks, in the hospital. A crucial finding was that in the first few days without food, the liver starts breaking down protein to make glucose to feed the brain. But using protein as fuel can be perilous, because it is the stuff of vital organs and muscle. But people do survive weeks of starvation. Dr. Cahill\u2019s study helped explain why. After about a week, the body makes another shift, and instead of cannibalizing its own proteins it starts breaking down fat into substances called ketones, which can feed the brain in place of glucose. A natural drop in insulin is what drives the shift to ketones, Dr. Cahill determined. The studies transformed scientists\u2019 understanding of starvation and the way insulin regulates metabolism, said Dr. Joseph Avruch, a professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School. On a practical level, the findings helped establish the importance of dietary protein to prevent organ damage in people who are on very low-calorie diets or who are ill or injured and not able to eat normally, said Dr. Rudolph Leibel, co-director of the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center at Columbia University Medical Center. In addition, Dr. Kahn said, Dr. Cahill helped the military formulate high-energy bars for emergency rations. In 1982 and 1985, Dr. Cahill was called as an expert witness for the prosecution in the two trials of Mr. von B\u00fclow for the attempted murder of his wife, Martha (also known as Sunny). Mrs. von B\u00fclow was in a deep coma, possibly caused by extremely low blood sugar. Her husband was accused of trying to kill her with insulin, which lowers blood sugar. Dr. Cahill reviewed more than two years of her medical records and testified at the first trial that her coma, and a prior one from which she had recovered, were caused by insulin. The insulin level in her blood, he told the court, was \u201cout of the ballpark.\u201d In the first trial, Mr. von B\u00fclow was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in prison. He appealed, the conviction was overturned, and he was tried again. At the second trial, Dr. Cahill showed up with a pocket full of sugar cubes, which he lined up on the witness stand to help explain his points. He testified that insulin was the only plausible explanation for Mrs. von B\u00fclow\u2019s coma, but the defense lawyer challenged him repeatedly. Finally, Dr. Cahill said, \u201cIt is so difficult for me to answer inane questions.\u201d Mr. von B\u00fclow was acquitted at the second trial. Dr. Cahill was disappointed, Dr. Kahn said, adding, \u201cI think he felt justice had not been done.\u201d Mrs. von B\u00fclow died in 2008, at 76, after nearly 28 years in a coma. George Francis Cahill Jr. was born in Manhattan on July 7, 1927. His father was a urologic surgeon at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons. George Jr. attended the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn., and entered Yale at 16. At 17 he enlisted in the Navy as a pharmacist\u2019s mate and was scheduled to take part in the invasion of Japan, but the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki changed that. After the war he finished college at Yale, and in 1953 he graduated from medical school at Columbia. He went on to become a professor of medicine at Harvard, and taught there until retiring in 1990. From 1958 until 1978 he also did research at the Joslin center, and from 1962 until 1990 he was a researcher and administrator for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which supports medical research. Besides Ms. Tiedemann, Dr. Cahill is survived by three other daughters, Colleen Cahill Remley, Sarah Rhett Cahill and Eva Wagner Cahill; two sons, Peter duPont Cahill and George F. Cahill III; and 15 grandchildren. His wife of 60 years, the former Sarah duPont, died in 2010. In an online article, Dr. Kahn called Dr. Cahill a \u201cconsummate teacher\u201d and said that when he retired from medicine he began teaching a biology course for nonscientists at Dartmouth College that was an overnight success.

Technicians have rescanned the card in HD to allow viewers to set the colour, contrast and sharpness on modern televisions. \"I haven't actually seen the image on television for about 10 years and we don't have an HD television so I would have to go into one of those electrical shops that sells televisions to see it, but I suspect if I did do that, I would just cringe and walk out,\" said Miss Hersee, a film and theatre costume maker, who has worked on films including The Last Emperor and Dangerous Liaisons and the west end production of The Phantom of the Opera. \"My children think it is amusing that the test card is back and they are more excited about it than I am.\" Test Card F has been broadcast for an estimated 70,000 hours since it was first shown on BBC 2 in 1967, and Miss Hersee, who was paid around \u00a3100 by the BBC when the image first appeared, is thought to hold the record for the most TV appearances by a single person. \"I think it [the record] is staggering, and now it has been brought back, there is no hope for anyone else to get anywhere near that record,\" she said. \"When we did it, nobody thought it would last for more than a few years, because none of the other test cards had.\" Miss Hersee said that she believed her father, who died in 2001, would be \"proud\" to see the return of his test card. \"I think my father would also be surprised that the BBC have decided to use it again,\" she said. \"But I think he would be quite proud of the fact that something he'd done so long ago has been brought back. I'd think he'd be smiling at the achievement that yet another generation will see his work.\"", "summary": "She has clocked up more air time on television than anyone else.

For months, I'd believed the Yankees erred in their determination -- equal parts medical, financial and competitive -- that Tanaka ought to rehabilitate his partially torn elbow ligament rather than undergo Tommy John surgery. I'm not a doctor -- breaking news, I know -- but the plan seemed dubious: If the operation is inevitable, as many experts believe, why not have it now and give Tanaka the best chance to contribute during the latter years of his $155 million contract? But every ulnar collateral ligament is unique. So is every repertoire, every mind, and every major-league pitcher. And with two perfect innings Thursday against the Atlanta Braves, in only his third game since the injury was diagnosed last July, Tanaka appeared to be a healthy 26-year-old who can perform at an elite level for the foreseeable future. \"He looks like he just came off a Cy Young, MVP, Rookie of the Year (season),\" said Braves catcher Christian Bethancourt, whom Tanaka retired on a groundout in the second inning. \"You can tell. I don't think he sweated a lot. \"From my standpoint, as a player, I don't think he was putting so much effort on (his pitches), and he was really, really good. He was comfortable. I think he feels like, when he's on the mound, he owns it. And he does.\" Braves hitting coach Kevin Seitzer saw Tanaka pitch during the 2014 regular season, when Seitzer held the same position with the Toronto Blue Jays. Seitzer said the pitcher he saw Thursday was no different than the one who beat the Jays three times last year. \"He was good -- down in the zone, mixed his pitches,\" Seitzer said. \"He was throwing strikes. He only went a couple innings, but he had good command. Same as last year, it seemed like... He looked normal.\" So, is Tanaka back? We can't be sure. We can't be sure about the health of anyone on a baseball field. Just ask the Blue Jays. Their ascendant ace, 23-year-old Marcus Stroman, was considered the best athlete on the team... and then tore the ACL in his left knee during a bunt-coverage drill earlier this week. He's out for the season. Tanaka, meanwhile, was so efficient in his spring debut -- 19 pitches, 15 strikes -- that he needed to throw 18 pitches in the bullpen afterward to reach his allotment for the evening. Tanaka threw several devastating split-fingered fastballs -- his signature pitch, and one that places particular torque on the compromised UCL. Fellow Yankees starter CC Sabathia said earlier Thursday that Tanaka has said continually this spring that he feels \"fine.\" Well, he was better than fine against the Braves. He was dominant against six major-league hitters, which should allow the Yankees to dream a little about their chances in a winnable American League East. Sabathia is part of that optimism, too, after an encouraging 29-pitch simulated game of his own, hours before Tanaka took the mound. Yankees manager Joe Girardi said Sabathia was able to push off his lower body effectively, following the right knee surgery that ended his 2014 season. Sabathia, 34, said his body hasn't felt this strong in spring training since 2012. To the extent that Tanaka and Sabathia are the bellwethers for the Yankees' postseason hopes in 2015 -- as I believe they are -- Thursday was a rousing success. Yes, the day also included the disappointing news that No. 5 starter Chris Capuano is probably out for all of April with a quadriceps injury. But if Tanaka, Sabathia, Michael Pineda and Nathan Eovaldi can do a credible job in the top four spots, then Girardi should be able to negotiate April with Adam Warren or Esmil Rogers taking a semi-regular turn (thanks to off days and inevitable rainouts). The larger divisional landscape is favorable, too: Stroman's injury has muted much of the excitement over Toronto's bid to end a two-decade playoff drought... The Yankees hired away a top reliever (Andrew Miller) from the defending division champion Orioles... A healthy Tanaka is better than any pitcher on the rival Red Sox pitching staff. For months, the Yankees have received criticism for not signing Max Scherzer or trading for Cole Hamels. Thursday, the greatest prize of the previous offseason was on full display, just as good as he ever was.", "summary": "New York Yankees starting pitcher Masahiro Tanaka looks strong in spring training debut, after opting for rehab and not Tommy John surgery.

So, Kurin said, \"we knew the cultural workers.\" His immediate concern for the safety of individual artists morphed into worries about the condition of the nation's paintings, musical instruments and art galleries. Once he started hearing from artists who had survived and he saw televised images of injured people pulling art from the rubble, Kurin developed a plan to get the Smithsonian involved in the recovery. \"Culture is important as a basic part of people's survival. The Smithsonian had the context there and we had the tools,\" he said. When the Folklife Festival opens Thursday, the Smithsonian will showcase one aspect of its Haiti initiative. It has expanded the core programs by inviting Boukman Eksperyans, a Grammy-nominated group, to perform its Haitian-Caribbean fusion sound Saturday. Two Haitian visual artists, Mireille Delisme and Levoy Exil, will also participate in the festival. Delisme will show how she incorporates voodoo designs into sequined flags. Exil will discuss how the Saint Soleil school of painting emerged from a mountain community. In the tented festival marketplace, paintings, metalwork, baskets and statues representing the crafts of 77 Haitian artists will be sold, with all proceeds helping the island's artists and art cooperatives. This year, at the 10-day, 44th annual Folklife Festival on the Mall, the focus will be on the cultures of Mexico and Asian Pacific Americans and on Smithsonian workers, such as the keepers of the fossils. The outdoor festival runs Thursday through Monday and then resumes July 1-5. Though most activities end at 5:30, the Smithsonian and the National Park Service sponsor evening concerts and dance parties. The festival's programs are selected by curators doing research on a topic or country, or on a particular anniversary. This allows the coordinators to dig deep into cultures and present a diversity of languages, music, food, dance and crafts. This year, in the tented areas, the small businesses of Mexico, celebrating the nation's 200th year of independence, will be represented by a candymaker from Xochimilco, instrument makers from Nayarit and Veracruz, and beekeepers from Campeche. The Asian Pacific Americans section, representing the roughly 30 Asian American and 24 Pacific Island American groups, will emphasize traditional dances and songs, including fusion styles. A local women's performance group, the Veiyasana Dance Troupe, will feature Fijian and Indian dances and island songs. In a second push to help Haiti, the Smithsonian is leading an international effort to preserve thousands of artworks that were rescued from collapsed structures. The Smithsonian has secured a 7,500-square-foot, three-story building, which formerly belonged to the U.N. Development Program, and is equipping it with generators, imported from Canada, and the supplies needed to repair broken frames, tears in canvases and water damage. Machines will also be used to rid the artworks of dust. \"The conservators went down with three suitcases of supplies. These are art and cultural humanitarians. They are caring, living under harsh conditions,\" Kurin said during an interview in his office in the Smithsonian Castle. \"We are essentially setting up a base, like we do in Antarctica.\" A folklorist and author, Kurin has been an official at the Smithsonian for 25 years and oversees the complex's art museums, among other divisions. Officially, he's the Smithsonian undersecretary for history, art and culture. Unofficially, he's a champion for world cultures. A tall man with salt-and-pepper hair, a mustache and beard, Kurin is a rapid, robust talker. He said he was shocked when he got to Haiti in early March. \"It was almost overwhelming. I went to the Catholic cathedral, which had these beautiful stained-glass windows, and I'm Jewish, and I just had to cry. The earthquake has taken the guts out of people,\" Kurin, 59, said. The Mus\u00c3\u00a9e d'Art Nader in Port-au-Prince, which had 9,000 to 10,000 paintings, was flattened. Kurin knew that Haiti's organizational resources were few, and that the infrastructure had collapsed, but he also understood that the local art community would tackle, and even survive, the most horrific hurdle. \"The Haitian people have this resilience. It is not easy, but people have a lot of pride, and they have always had to look inward to get strength,\" Kurin said. \"From the earliest time, [their] art expressed many feelings. It was a way of decoding nationhood and freedom.\" Liberation from the French in 18o4 and scenes of everyday life have been themes of a bold, colorful and intricate art style that stretches back five centuries. Since the earthquake, artists have created works out of twisted metal. In addition to Haiti's presence on the Mall, nearly 100 works of art created by the children of Haiti after the quake are on display at the S. Dillon Ripley Center until Oct. 17, under the sponsorship of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art. Collaborating with the Smithsonian in the Haiti recovery project are the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities, the Broadway League, UNESCO and the U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield, a non-governmental organization. The Broadway League has donated $276,000 for rent and other costs. The National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute of Museum and Library Services have each donated $30,000. The project is being coordinated with Haiti's Ministry of Culture and Communication and the country's reconstruction commission. That partnership is key, Kurin said, because the longer goals of the recovery program include training Haitians in conservation methods and museum skills. The outreach, Kurin said, will show that Haiti has not been defeated, and \"this is a lively, ongoing, living tradition.\"", "summary": "When Richard Kurin heard about the catastrophic earthquake in Haiti last January, he was heartbroken. As point man for decades for the annual Smithsonian Folklife Festival, he knew the Smithsonian had to do something."}, {"text": "On Sunday afternoon against the arch-nemesis Pittsburgh Penguins, the Capitals did precisely that. For the second straight game, Washington didn't hesitate to attack its foe or muck up play in the corners and along the boards. It was not overtly flashy, but the passionate, blue-collar, disciplined hockey on display in the Capitals' 3-0 win against the Penguins at Verizon Center may be evidence of a team regaining its confidence. \"I think we're starting to get our identity back,\" said Brooks Laich, who scored Washington's first goal against the Penguins. \"We're a committed group right now. The coaching staff lays out a great game plan for us, makes it easy to play.... It was a challenge for us [to get back on track]. Even after this, the next 10 games aren't easy. The next two or three weeks can really sway our season.\" Laich, Marcus Johansson and Mike Knuble each recorded a goal and Michal Neuvirth, making his first appearance since Jan. 18 in Philadelphia, made 22 saves for the second shutout of his NHL career. Defenseman Mike Green, who left the game after a slap shot by Brooks Orpik struck him in the head near his right ear and required stitches, said afterward \"it's just a cut\" and that he was \"fine now.\" Pittsburgh was without Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin, who are recovering from a concussion and torn knee ligaments respectively, but the absence of those star players on the opposing roster didn't diminish the importance of the victory for Washington (29-15-10), which remains three points behind first-place Tampa Bay in the Southeast Division. The Capitals' commitment to their responsible, gritty style in pursuit of a second straight win may have been the main event on display, but of course no meeting against the rival Penguins (34-16-4) would be complete without some new form of vitriol to fuel the teams' mutual dislike. This time it came in the form of a knee-on-knee hit by Pittsburgh's Matt Cooke on Alex Ovechkin late in the third period. Ovechkin skated away unharmed, and then he and Nicklas Backstrom confronted and punched Cooke in the moments afterward. Coach Bruce Boudreau didn't buy any attempt to claim the collision was accidental from Cooke, who has been suspended multiple times and has a reputation as one of the NHL's more reckless players. \"It was Matt Cooke. Need we say more?\" Boudreau said. \"It's not like it's his first rodeo. He's done it to everybody and then he goes to the ref and says, 'What did I do?' He knows damn well what he did.\" In the first period there weren't many shots or quality scoring chances, but the desire of both teams to win battles along the boards and behind the goal line kept a fast pace, punctuated early and often by players for both teams finishing their checks. Each of the Capitals' forward lines was able to create and sustain a forecheck in the Pittsburgh zone in the first period, and eventually the cycling paid off. Laich gave the Capitals the initial lead for just the 23rd time this season when he pounced on a rebound from a point shot by defenseman John Erskine. The puck jumped directly out in front of Pittsburgh's Marc-Andre Fleury, and Laich was able to maneuver around the scrambling goaltender to stuff it into the net. The tally marked the first time Laich has scored in back-to-back games since the first two games of the regular season in October. Washington had a would-be second goal waved off in the first two minutes of the second period as Matt Hendricks was whistled for goaltender interference, but the subsequent penalty kill managed to do more than simply thwart the Pittsburgh advantage. Kris Letang turned the puck over at the Washington blue line where Johansson scooped it up and went the other way. Johansson maneuvered around Pittsburgh's Letang and Paul Martin to take a nifty backhand shot that found the upper left-hand corner of the net as David Steckel screened Fleury for a 2-0 Capitals lead. With a two-goal cushion, the Capitals stayed the course and began to lean on their neutral zone and defensive play to stifle the Penguins as they tried to take chances and push back. But Pittsburgh wasn't able to manufacture any substantial momentum after allowing the short-handed tally, and Knuble would eventually add an empty-netter for the finishing flourish. \"All goals are important,\" Johansson said, \"but getting a 2-0 lead on their power play, I think took them down a little bit. It was hard for them to come back, and I think we did a great job shutting them out.\"", "summary": "All season, the Washington Capitals have searched for complete games, contests in which they set their own tone and agenda from the opening faceoff rather than wait for an opponent to dictate the course."}, {"text": "For U.S. space flight, the retirement of the Space Shuttle program means the country must now rely on its Russian partners for transport to the International Space Station.

When pressed about his favorite wakeup song -- having to choose between the likes of Elton John, Paul McCartney, or Michael Stipe of REM -- specialist Rex Walheim couldn\u2019t choose just one. \u201cThey were all obviously amazing and it was quite a treat to sit there in the dark of the space shuttle to listen to those songs,\u201d he said. In the end, it wasn\u2019t about the music. \u201cMore important than the song were the personal greetings, \u201cWalheim explained. \u201cThat those fantastic artists took time out to say good morning -- it just meant the world to us.\u201d", "summary": "With only a day left in what will be a historic final flight for American space shuttles, the four astronauts aboard Atlantis shared parting thoughts on what it means to rely on the Russians, what NASA needs to do moving forward, and their favorite wake-up song."}, {"text": "Friends told me that I would feel at home in Boston because of its strong European influence, and they were right.

Follow, for example, the red line painted on the footpaths of the meandering Freedom Trail, which will lead you to 16 historical sites over the course of a few hours, encompassing two and a half centuries of the US's most significant past. In the city's North End you will walk by the 17th-century colonial home of American patriot Paul Revere. Continue a little further on Tremont Street and you'll discover the equally historic cemetery, King's Chapel Burying Ground, beside King's Chapel, the oldest in the city. Another enjoyable way to discover the area is on wheels. Hubway, the city bike scheme, is similar to the V\u00e9lib' in Paris or the Boris bikes in London: riders can pick up and drop off a bike at different stations across the city (and also neighbouring towns). Continue your visit with a stop at one of the city's museums, such as the recently renovated Institute of Contemporary Art, or the stately Museum of Fine Arts in Fenway. And with its courtyard garden, new Renzo Piano-designed extension and outstanding private collection of art, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museumcorrect \"was designed as a work of art in totality\". The Charles river, which separates Boston from Cambridge, is a central feature of the city; it's flanked by paths on each side for the runners and cyclists who make use of them. Season permitting, you can even choose to go down the river itself \u2013 canoes and kayaks can be easily rented at several locations. If you happen to visit in October, go to the Head of the Charles Regatta, the world's largest rowing event: over the course of a weekend, nearly 300,000 spectators gather to cheer on the 9,000 competing rowers. Since you will almost certainly cross the river to Cambridge, make a stop at Upstairs on the Square for lunch or dinner. This storied restaurant houses two dining rooms: an upscale, gilt-laden fantasy land on the third floor, where it offers a five- or seven-course tasting menu ($72/$95); and in an equally flamboyant room on the second floor you can dine on lobster pizza for $19 or whole-milk ricotta homemade cavatelli with sweet pea and smoked ham for $14. During Sunday brunch, expect the arrival of the renowned Harvard Krokodiloes, a group of a cappella singers formed of tuxedo-clad undergraduates from the university. When in Harvard Square, I always pay a visit to Formaggio Kitchen to stock up on a selection of the best imported cheese and cured meats in town, including bresaola, jam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico and speck. Then it's to the Hi-Rise Bread Company for a baguette and a loaf of country bread. Boston's location on the Atlantic coast means that, of course, the seafood is excellent. For delicious oysters, lobster, clam chowder and other seafood delicacies, I'd recommend Island Creek Oyster Bar in Kenmore Square. It has one of the best raw bars in town; the oysters are local to New England (Wellfleet and Chatham in Massachusetts, or from Rhode Island) and are sold by the piece for $3. It also serves a delicious halibut ceviche with cucumber, lime and coriander for $9, and a shellfish platter for four to share, for $80. North End, near the harbour, is the neighbourhood to visit for authentic Italian food. Try Mike's Pastry shop for cannoli or tiramisu, before heading to DePasquale's Homemade Pasta Shoppe for freshly made pumpkin ravioli and orecchiette to take home. For a completely different atmosphere, and a more elegant dining experience, I'd suggest Clio or L'Espalier near Newbury Street, one of the city's upscale shopping streets. Both impress with imaginative food. At L'Espalier, try the chilled Casco Bay lobster salad with cucumber gazpacho gel\u00e9e, pickled grapes, almond and compressed cucumbers, or the sweet corn bisque with roasted new onion and popcorn powder \u2013 it's outstanding. However, the restaurant I keep coming back to is Bergamot in Somerville, for its excellent service and seasonal ingredients. During the city's restaurant week, a choice of any appetizer, main and dessert can be had for $38. The charcuterie is house-made, and its salads and desserts stand out \u2013 as I'm French, I find the hazelnut clafoutis, served with peaches, whipped ricotta, brown butter and peach sorbet, impossible to resist. During the summer, farmer's markets pop up in parts of town, selling fresh vegetables and fruit. Copley Square, in downtown Boston, hosts a market on Tuesdays and Fridays. On Sundays from May to October, SoWa Open Market, in the South End, includes arts and crafts designers, a farmer's market, and a wide selection of food trucks.Stop for a lunch of kale salad, sweet corn and poblano fritters at Mei Mei Street Kitchen. There are several beautiful parks in the city. Swan boats are a highlight at Boston Common, near the historic Beacon Hill neighbourhood; while south of the city are the Arnold Arboretum and Jamaica Pond, which is good for a long walk, especially in spring and fall, with its cherry blossoms and changing leaf colours. Finally, takea trip to the north shore beaches (Crane Beach or Plum Island), or to Cape Cod and its islands \u2013 Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. Go off-season, in spring or fall, and you might have the sandy beaches and parks to yourself. B\u00e9atrice Peltre, food writer and stylist based in Boston.

If you\u2019ve always wanted to learn to surf or try your hand at archery, all in some truly spectacular surroundings, now is your chance. Perhaps you\u2019d rather learn to cook local dishes in an alfresco kitchen? Or try yoga on the beach? If you like a holiday that offers more than just a beautiful location and endless sunshine, why not try some of these Robinson clubs? Whether you have children who need to be fed or a busy working life, finding time to learn new cooking skills is a challenge.Expert chefs share all the tricks and skills required to cook to a professional standard. In the summer you may even learn to cook in the open air. Heaven. The landscape surrounding the hotel has some of the best cycling terrain in the world. Whether you want to ride along the glorious coast on a road bike or take on some serious climbs and downhills in the Sierra Nevada, there are options for all abilities. Robinson can also organise group tours to Salobre\u00f1a and Calahonda. Your holiday experiences of archery are probably limited to cheap equipment in a random part of the hotel. But here there\u2019s a unique archery centre with distances of up to 40m for true experts. There are also beginners\u2019 classes for keen novices. This exciting game, which originated in Mexico, is a cross between tennis and squash. There is a net, and back and side walls to bounce the ball off. This hotel has introduced the game for the first time this year. Robinson coined this term to describe its extensive spa and fitness facilities. At Cala Serena there is a huge range, including a fitness studio, GroupFitness classes including step, Aqua Fit and indoor cycling, a body and mind room offering yoga and Stretch & Relax classes and the soothing WellFit spa, with a Finnish sauna and even a Cleopatra bath (additional charge). The Red Sea is a veritable Eden of underwater delights and when you stay at Soma Bay in Hurghada you can take a range of diving courses to explore the world beneath the sea. The latest dive equipment waits and instructors can guide you from a taster session to your PADI Open Water qualification and beyond with SSI Diamond Dive Resort Daily excursions. The ultra-sporty can even try freediving, or if you prefer, there are snorkelling courses available. It is astonishing how much you can do with a ball, especially at Robinson. At Soma Bay guests can choose from beach football and volleyball, water polo, basketball and boccia. Next door to the hotel are two 18-hole courses with extraordinary views. And within easy distance are several more, meaning even the biggest golf addicts will not run out of new holes to play. For beginners and improvers there are opportunities to learn the secrets of the game. With a backdrop of a pristine natural park and wonderful birdlife, there is so much to find out about your surroundings while dipping your toes into the ocean. Arguably the easiest to pick up and the most pleasant water-based board sport, it is a very simple and fun way to enjoy the sea. Cruise across calm seas enjoying the views. It\u2019s a surprisingly good workout, too. 11. Sundowner on the beach A classic holiday highlight wherever there is a beach and a bar but as with everything it does, Robinson makes it a little more special, with live music, great drinks and soft sand underfoot. Leave Agadir in a 4x4 and you will soon be surrounded by banana plantations and enter a magnificent palm grove with almond, olive and argan trees everywhere.

Skilling, the brash, self-made executive who powered Enron Corp. to international acclaim only to watch it descend into bankruptcy protection and notoriety, took the witness stand Monday in his fraud trial to declare himself \"absolutely innocent.\" Skilling, 52, admitted he was emotional, even nervous, as he stepped forward during the 11th week of the trial to take an oath to tell the truth. \"I guess in some way my life is on the line.\" Defending himself against charges that he lied to the public about Enron's health and bailed out when he knew the company was failing, the former chief executive took jurors on what he described as his own emotional journey, from the excitement of building one of the nation's most powerful companies to what he called his exhaustion and distress at the toll his commitment to Enron had taken on his own family. Later, Enron's collapse led to drinking and depression, he told the jurors. Skilling, who earned $152 million from 1999 to his departure in 2001, said he had worked tirelessly over a decade to transform Enron from a stodgy pipeline company into a business that traded energy. Proclaiming the firm \"the finest company in the world,\" Skilling told the jury \"there was excitement, there was electricity\" back in the days when he strode through the doors of the glass tower that once dominated Houston. But by 2000, the long work days had turned into something that was \"emotionally exhausting,\" Skilling said. \"Some people would say I was obsessed by Enron.... I had not spent the time I should have spent in my family.\" He returned from a three-week African safari with the realization that he no longer wanted to lead the company. He broached the idea with Enron founder and then-Chairman Kenneth L. Lay, his charming, charismatic fellow defendant who will testify later in the trial. \"I said, 'I really hate this job,' \" Skilling recounted, looking at Lay at the defense table, with Lay watching him. \"And I think Ken said, 'Oh no, not again.' \" The departure was averted. Months later, in 2001, on what he called \"that fateful day, Friday the 13th of July,\" Skilling's desire to leave returned in force. He said he drafted a resignation letter and talked with his son, asking, \"Would you still respect me if I do that?\" As Skilling described the moment from the witness stand, his wife, Rebecca Carter, a former secretary to Enron's board, looked over at her stepson with tear-filled eyes. The story Skilling told the jury yesterday is counter to the prosecution's contention that he saw Enron on the verge of collapse and decided to get out while he could, rushing to sell his stock before what he knew became public. \"The charges against me are wrong,\" Skilling continued, as jurors craned forward to hear him. \"I am innocent of those charges. I will fight those charges until the day I die.\" He asked for a cup of water and frequently looked out at relatives in the front row, including his wife, his brother, his former wife, two sons, and his 22-year-old daughter, who left the room briefly and returned clutching tissues in both hands. Skilling, wearing a gray suit, white shirt and a blue and green tie, offered few glimpses of the arrogance for which he was known inside the energy trading company and which he displayed in testimony before Congress in 2002, just months after employees lost billions of dollars in retirement savings and his company had become synonymous with fraud.", "summary": "Get Washington DC, Virginia, Maryland and national news.

According to New York Magazine (Alexa Tsoulis-Reay), the daughter, who is now 18, grew up almost never seeing her father (except for weekends between ages 3 and 5). When she was 17, she got back in touch with him, and they quickly began a romantic and sexual relationship. (It\u2019s not clear what state this was in, so it\u2019s not clear whether the sex would have been criminal absent the incestuous component: three-quarters of states have the general age of consent set at 17 or younger.) I thought this would be a good opportunity for me to ask again ask a few questions I ask some years ago about adult-adult incest (speaking specifically of parent-child, grandparent-grandchild, or brother-sister, and setting aside cousins and the like): (1) Should it be illegal, and, if so, exactly why? Is it just because it\u2019s immoral? Because legalizing incest would, by making a future sexual relationship more speakable and legitimate, potentially affect the family relationship even while the child is underage (the view to which I tentatively incline)? Because it involves a heightened risk of birth defects (a view I\u2019m skeptical about, given that we don\u2019t criminalize sex by carriers of genes that make serious hereditary disease much more likely than incest does)? (2) Given Lawrence v. Texas \u2014 and similar pre-Lawrence decisions in several states, applying their state constitutions \u2014 what exactly is the basis for outlawing adult incest? (Imagine, for instance, a relationship such as the one described earlier in the post, but one in which there was no sex \u2014 and even no preparations for sex \u2014 until after age 18.) Is it that bans on gay sex are irrational but bans on adult incest are rational, and rationality is all that\u2019s required for regulations of adult sex? Is it that bans on gay sex don\u2019t pass strict scrutiny (or some such demanding test) but bans on adult incest do? Is it that Lawrence rested on the fact that bans on gay sex largely foreclose all personally meaningful sexual relationships for those who are purely homosexual in orientation, whereas incest bans only foreclose a few possible sexual partners? (For court cases on this, see here (stepfather-stepdaughter) and here (brother-sister).) (3) If adult incest is indeed criminalized, what should the penalties be (assuming lack of further aggravating circumstances, such as force, strong evidence of grooming for future adult incest during childhood, and so on)? Should the penalty be relatively light, on the theory that only consenting adults were involved (much as the penalty for prostitution is relatively light)? Should it be very grave, on the theory that it\u2019s important to send a firm, unambiguous message that such behavior is wrong, or perhaps on the theory that one party is likely to have seriously harmed the other even though the other consented? (4) Should all this apply to adult brother-sister incest, or are the arguments chiefly limited to what one sees as the likely special emotional control that parents might have over children? UPDATE: By the way, my former coauthor, Brett McDonnell, has an interesting article on the constitutional question, Is Incest Next?. Eugene Volokh teaches free speech law, religious freedom law, church-state relations law, a First Amendment Amicus Brief Clinic, and tort law, at UCLA School of Law, where he has also often taught copyright law, criminal law, and a seminar on firearms regulation policy.", "summary": "New Jersey apparently doesn't criminalize sex among adult relatives -- should it? Or should consenting adults be free to have sex, even if they are a father and a daughter (or a brother and a sister)?"}, {"text": "Danny Mullan doesn\u2019t have to work very hard to explain the allure of the sporting event he organized earlier this summer in New Jersey. It can be summed up in about five words. Guys wrestling on the beach. If there\u2019s any confusion, just add the word shirtless. \u201cHigh school girls love cut and in-shape high school guys,\u201d says Mr. Mullan, a board member of USA Wrestling\u2019s New Jersey chapter who organized the New Jersey State Beach Championships at Asbury Park in July. There, wrestlers tripped, flipped and grappled one another on the sand as DJs played jock anthems and young women in bikinis looked on. \u201cIt\u2019s a great atmosphere,\u201d Mr. Mullan said. \u201cIt\u2019s the old gladiator type of wrestling.\u201d Across the country\u2014and as far away as Albania\u2014advocates for this ancient Olympic sport are looking for new ways to drag it out of a slump. While overall participation in high schools in the U.S. is stable, many U.S. colleges have eliminated their wrestling programs\u2014often to add more women\u2019s sports. In the meantime, many wrestlers all over the world have gravitated to more glamorous (and more lucrative) forms of athletic combat, like mixed martial arts, which combine elements of boxing, judo, kickboxing and wrestling, and where wrestlers have proven to be some of the best competitors. To win them back, wrestling officials have embraced the beach version of the sport. FILA, the international wrestling authority, made beach wrestling an international sport shortly after the 2004 Olympics. This year\u2019s FILA Beach World Championships will happen in Obzor, Bulgaria, on the Black Sea Coast Aug. 28-30. Previous world championships were held in Turkey and Albania. Beach wrestling is less technical than the Olympic and collegiate styles. The rules are simple: The first wrestler to get three points wins. If you throw an opponent out of the ring or take him down, you get a point. And all the moves must be made on sand, which places an emphasis on brute strength rather than quickness and technique. \u201cA lot more brawn comes into play just because of the logistics of it,\u201d said Mr. Mullan. At the New Jersey event, which was open to of all ages, 160 wrestlers paid a $25 entrance fee to participate. The wrestlers were separated by their weight classes and experience levels and allowed to wrestle three matches for a chance to win the trophy. Instead of wearing singlets\u2014the tight and somewhat dorky traditional uniform of the sport\u2014the participants were allowed to wear baggy board shorts. Tim Vanderveer, a 24-year-old from Berkeley Heights, N.J., called the nervous jitters \u201cawesome!\u201d after he won the 180-pound division in the open category. Mr. Vanderveer, a billing analyst at AIG Inc., said this was his first competitive wrestling event since graduating from high school. \u201cI had something unfulfilled,\u201d he said, with sweat and sand stuck to his face. \u201cI had something in the basement, something I wanted to do.\u201d That same day, in the youth division, Donovan \u201cDonnie\u201d Cataldi, 7, and Thomas O\u2019Keefe, 8, circled each other warily on the sand as parents, friends and passers-by along the boardwalk cheered and yelled commands. A crowd of 500 or so watched and hundreds more stopped along the boardwalk to gawk. At one point, both of them had so much grit on their faces that the referee blew the whistle and said: \u201cGo to the bucket.\u201d The two boys ran to a large, blue pail and dunked their heads in the water. \u201cThese studs are gettin\u2019 clean,\u201d said Brian Miller, Donnie\u2019s coach, as he helped slap water on their faces to get the sand out of their eyes. Wrestling remains healthy in U.S. high schools, growing steadily with 264,527 wrestlers in 11,377 high schools in 2007-2008, up from 262,294 wrestlers and 10,672 high-school programs in 2006-2007, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations in Indianapolis. Still, the levels are far below those of marquee sports, such as football, with 1.1 milion high school players in 13,987 high schools. Wrestling really tumbles at the college level, however, where the number of programs has slid from 363 in 1981-82 to 227 now, according to the NCAA, largely because of budget cuts in athletic departments related to Title IX. At the same time, the number of college football teams has grown to 629. Dan Gable, the Olympic gold medalist and former University of Iowa wrestling coach, says beach wrestling could be \u201can attraction to help draw a little more interest to our sport.\u201d But he said the main focus of wrestling in the U.S. should stay on freestyle and Greco-Roman styles, the two Olympic forms. The U.S. has done well internationally in these events in the past but has seen fewer medals lately, he said. Advocates of beach wrestling say it\u2019s a long shot, but there could someday be an attempt to make this an Olympic sport. In the meantime, more events like the one at Asbury Park are likely to happen around the country. Whether or not it can make the sport more appealing to a mass audience remains to be seen. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this before,\u201d said Liz Urcinas, a spectator at the Asbury Park event. \u201cWrestling\u2019s a bit of a weird sport.\u201d Write to Paul Glader at paul.glader@wsj.com", "summary": "Wrestling has moved from dank high-school gymnasiums to the beach.

The incidence has more than doubled in developed countries in recent decades. More than six million children in the United States have asthma, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as do more than 330 million children and adults worldwide, according to the Global Asthma Network. Dr. Bisgaard said it was not possible to tell from the study whether pregnant women could benefit from simply eating more fish. Pregnant women are generally advised to limit their consumption of certain types of fish like swordfish and tuna because they contain mercury. But many other types are considered safe, especially smaller fish like sardines that are not at the top of the food chain and therefore not likely to accumulate mercury and other contaminants from eating other fish. The results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The scientists bought fish oil from a company that makes it, but they said the company had no role in the study. The research was paid for by the Danish government and private foundations. An editorial in the same journal by an expert who was not part of the study praised the research, saying it was well designed and carefully performed. The author of that editorial, Dr. Christopher E. Ramsden, from the National Institutes of Health, said the findings would help doctors develop a \u201cprecision medicine\u201d approach in which fish-oil treatment could be tailored to women who are most likely to benefit. But Dr. Ramsden also said it was too soon to put the new findings into practice, and he recommended further study. Previous research had suggested that fish oil might help prevent asthma. The idea is plausible, because inflammation in the airways and lungs plays a major role in asthma, and fatty acids in fish oil are thought to prevent inflammation. The richest sources in food include fish like herring, sardines, mackerel, eel and salmon. Because the earlier studies suggesting a benefit from fish oil were not conclusive, the Danish researchers decided to test the idea. They recruited 736 women. Starting in their third trimester, half the women took 2.4 grams of fish oil a day and half took placebo capsules of olive oil, continuing until one week after birth. About a quarter of the mothers and a fifth of the fathers had asthma, and they were evenly distributed between the fish-oil and placebo groups. The capsules were an over-the-counter product called Incromega TG33/22, a fish extract made by the British chemical company Croda Health Care. The extract contained the fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The researchers tracked the children\u2019s health, finding asthma less common in those whose mothers had taken the fish oil, with the effect lasting at least through age 7, the longest follow-up. By age 3, the biggest difference had emerged from data on mothers who, before treatment, had the lowest levels of EPA and DHA in their blood. In that group, only 17.5 percent of the children whose mothers took fish oil developed asthma, compared with 34.1 percent whose mothers took the placebo \u2014 a difference of 16.6 percentage points, and a risk reduction of about 54 percent. Low levels of EPA and DHA in the blood can be related to diet but also to genetics. The body normally converts another fatty acid, found in plant-based foods, to EPA and DHA. But some people \u2014 about 13 percent in the study \u2014 carry a genetic variant that impairs their ability to make the conversion. The researchers found that children born to women with little EPA and DHA in their diets, and to women with the genetic variant, were among those most likely to benefit from exposure to fish oil in pregnancy. Dr. Bisgaard said that, pending further study, the best way to apply the findings would probably be to test women for the fatty-acid levels in their blood, and for the genetic variant, to determine who might benefit from fish oil. He said that genetics could differ among different populations and that there might be ethnic variations in risk.

Robert L. Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television and a prominent Clinton confidant, said in an interview that she was \"absolutely ready\" to talk to Obama about the No. 2 slot and would take it if offered. The vice presidential talk and pressure on Clinton to quit the race created an awkward ending to the Democratic race at a time when Obama is eager to turn his attention to the general-election campaign against Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the presumptive Republican nominee. McCain, meanwhile, put his opponent on the spot yesterday with a call for 10 joint town hall meetings at which he and Obama would share the stage and begin a dialogue that would be unprecedented in modern presidential politics. Although Obama was the newly crowned winner of the Democratic race, the focus remained on Clinton through much of yesterday as Democrats pushed anxiously for her to bring her candidacy to an end. Even some supporters of Clinton were baffled by the fact that she had still neither endorsed Obama nor announced an intention to continue fighting for the nomination all the way through the Democratic National Convention in August. Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.), one of Clinton's most stalwart supporters, said he would back her efforts to join Obama on the ticket. But, he added, it is incumbent on her to acknowledge she had lost the fight to Obama. \"What I don't know is what the heck she needs this extra time for,\" he said, referring to Clinton's speech Tuesday, in which she said she would take a few days to consider her options. \"How much more time does she need to be able to say the person she wants to help is Barack Obama?

MIAMI BEACH \u2014 In this decadent, hard-partying playground, Kirsty Bertarelli\u2019s 40th birthday celebration rivaled the best of them. More than 200 guests flew in from Europe. A caravan of limousines ferried them to the site, a flashy waterfront home. The party rocked until 4:30 a.m. It cost $3 million. The 29,000-square-foot Five Star Island house in Miami Beach was rented out by Ernesto Bertarelli for his wife Kirsty's 40th birthday party. Although such rentals are illegal, the law is often ignored. But the fact that it almost did not happen \u2014 that a judge had to decide on the very day of the event whether to allow it\u2014 has reignited an increasingly familiar debate here: When does someone\u2019s really good time become the bane of someone else\u2019s existence? Or, in the case at hand, did one billionaire homeowner rent out his mansion for another billionaire\u2019s party in violation of a local ordinance? \u201cKirsty\u2019s Fabulous 40th Birthday Party,\u201d as it was billed, was given last month by Ernesto Bertarelli, a Swiss billionaire ranked No. 64 on Forbes\u2019s most-wealthy list, for his wife, a singer and a onetime British beauty pageant winner. It was held on Star Island, a spot of land on Biscayne Bay beautified two decades ago by the developer Thomas Kramer, a lover of late-night bacchanals and no stranger to controversy. Mr. Kramer rented his estate, Five Star Island, to the Bertarellis for $40,000, a sum that barely covered his expenses, he said. The day before the party, a routine request to the Fire Department to have paramedics on hand caused the city to review the rental agreement, and then threaten to shut down the affair with a police roadblock. That led to a court hearing in downtown Miami. At risk were the reputations of the rich and famous, Ms. Bertarelli\u2019s feelings, the tempers of moneyed, jet-lagged guests, and Miami Beach\u2019s tolerance for the whims of the wealthy. \u201cMy wife\u2019s 40th birthday will be ruined and forever remembered as a public disgrace to my family unless the party goes forward,\u201d Mr. Bertarelli told the court, via affidavit, since presumably he was busy preparing for the event. Summoned on a Saturday afternoon for a rare party-related emergency hearing, Circuit Judge Jose R. Rodriguez listened as lawyers explained that the Bertarellis had no idea their one-night house rental was illegal in Miami Beach, a claim that no one disputed. The judge, holding the ordinance to be ambiguous, swiftly dispensed with the case: The party should go on. The mayor, Mattie Herrera Bower, is incredulous. \u201cIf you have enough money, you can get a lawyer to get a judge to break the law,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was unhappy about the precedent. We have a law for a reason, and everybody \u2014 even people with money \u2014 needs to obey it.\u201d At the center of the imbroglio is a Miami Beach ordinance that bans using a single-family home for commercial purposes, namely holding parties where money changes hands between the homeowner and the party host. The city passed the ordinance in 2008 after too many mansions were being used as ballrooms-for-hire, jammed with indiscreet partygoers who turned up the music, parked willy-nilly and raised the hackles of the Beach\u2019s well-to-do residents. But the law hardly halted the one-night party house rentals; in fact, the listings increased and the parties of out-of-town revelers bobbed below the city\u2019s radar. \u201cDuring a certain period of the year, every other weekend something was going on: a launch for a vodka company, a launch for an automobile company, promoters with an after-party,\u201d said Jorge Gomez, an assistant city manager for planning and zoning. \u201cHundreds of cars descending on the neighborhood, valet operations stashing cars all over the place \u2014 it really had a big impact.\u201d At the same time, owners began renting out their mansions for the night, the week or the month, a result, in part, of the drastic economic downturn. A trio of islands on the bay west of Miami Beach (of which Star is one) may bask in the glow of wealth, but that kind of luxury comes at a price.

They're not games, mind you, but it offers a way to create a custom avatar or silly bobblehead that looks like you, or the ability to animate objects, such as your favorite stuffed animal, and slap on googly eyes, too. Once you download the 700+ megabyte download, you can place your \"hand\" over the Gadget (application) you want to try out. Initially, there are four to choose from in Kinect Fun Labs -- two for body scanning and two for object scanning -- but more will be available in July. Specifically, here's what you get in the initial digital download: -- Kinect Me lets you create an avatar that looks like you. It'll tell you to move closer to the camera so it can scan your face and body. You'll follow the instructions, so that the red dotted lines turn into green ones when you're positioned correctly. You'll also need to remove any hat you're wearing. You'll be asked a couple of questions, such as if you want glasses or a ponytail, then after the drum roll, it shows your custom-made avatar. Mine didn't look very much like me, actually, but it got the gray hoodie and blue jeans perfectly; my kids had more luck with their avatar faces. Once you're done, you can pose for a photo shoot or create an animated flip book. -- As you'd expect from the name, Bobble Head also uses face- and body-scanning technology to create a bobblehead you can place on your virtual dashboard and smack around with your hand to see it bobble back and forth. You can have friends or family members lined up to smack around, too. Similar to Kinect Me, you can post your creations through KinectShare.com to various social-networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. -- With Build A Buddy, you can hold up objects to Kinect -- such as a cushion, plush toy or action figure -- and once you scan the front and back, you'll see it magically appear onscreen. Then you can interact with it, add your voice and record silly videos, if you like. The objects can't be too wide, however, so you might need to alter its orientation when being scanned (I held up a fish toy but had to hold it vertically instead of horizontally). The scanning worked great, though. -- Kinect Googly Eyes is similar to Build A Buddy but places silly googly eyes on the object you hold up -- so don't use an object that has big eyes already (like my orange and white fish). Once the virtual object is scanned -- and try to keep your hands out of the picture, if you can -- you can animate the object in real-time by jumping up, crouching down or outstretching your arms. You can change the eyes, create a recorded puppet show and share your creation. -- Coming next month, Kinect Sparkler lets you first create an object for the background -- such as a still of you in your room -- then use your fingertip to paint around objects with a sparkler. It worked great in the E3 demo, as you can lean forward and back to draw in a 3D around objects (such as yourself). The effect is quite cool, and you can lean left or right to rotate the view somewhat Also coming next month is Avatar Kinect, which will allow you to hang out with up to seven friends in various virtual environments -- including a talk show set or tailgate party.

Military officers and enlistees mixed with civilians in a two-sided receiving line, waving small American flags and clapping for the elderly veterans who had survived World War II, Korea and, now, Katrina. \"Welcome to D.C.! Welcome to your new home,\" said Rochelle Jones, a staffer for the U.S. Army Community and Family Support Center in Alexandria. Stepping forward, she enveloped Jim Holder in a hug. \"Oh, honey, I love you,\" said Holder, who wore a light shirt, khaki shorts, white socks and black loafers, and clutched a plastic shopping bag stuffed with a few belongings. Jones hugged harder. \"I love you, too.\" Holder was among 415 veterans evacuated from the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Gulfport, Miss., after Hurricane Katrina flooded the ground floor of their quarters Monday, leaving them without electricity or running water. About 250 evacuees arrived just before noon at the leafy, landscaped campus of their sister home in Northwest Washington, exhausted from a trip that stretched across two days and several states. The most frail were flown to Washington separately, while two hardy retirees drove in a private vehicle. Dozens more were expected to trickle in soon. With their Mississippi beachfront facility uninhabitable, and much of the neighborhood around it destroyed, the retirees will stay at the D.C. home for at least several months, said Timothy C. Cox, chief operating officer of both entities. A spokeswoman for the home said the facility has about 1,000 permanent residents but can accommodate up to 1,700. Military veterans and retirees who have reservations to enter will not lose their places, officials said. News that the retirees in Gulfport needed a haven prompted a flurry of activity at the historic D.C. campus, built on 276 hilly acres between North Capitol Street and the Brightwood neighborhood. Hundreds of staffers and volunteers cleaned 400 empty rooms in a dormitory and an unused residential building; hauled in beds, nightstands and clothes lockers; hung towels; tucked in sheets and blankets; and prepared bags of donated toiletries and snacks. Melodie R. Menke, director of volunteer services at the home, said a public appeal for assistance prompted thousands of responses, including one by a mother and son from Michigan on vacation in Washington. \"They jammed the phone lines, they jammed the e-mail; we had just an outpouring of people,\" Menke said. \" 'I want to help our vets. They helped us.' Almost everybody used that line.\" The Gulfport facility opened in Philadelphia in 1834 for Navy retirees and relocated to Mississippi in 1976. It was merged administratively with the D.C. facility -- known at that time as the Soldiers' and Airmen's Home -- in 1991. Both homes were open to veterans who had served at least 20 years, served in a war theater or retired with a service-related injury. Cox said yesterday it is too soon to know whether the Gulfport home will be rebuilt. The evacuees clambered down from the buses looking dazed, some using canes, walkers or wheelchairs, others toting pillows or oxygen tanks. They'd been permitted to pack a single suitcase before leaving, and officials said they did not know how much of the remaining belongings could be salvaged.

He shouldn\u2019t be balancing the budget on the backs of these kids.\u201d The $63 million is part of more than $640 million in new state aid stemming from a 1993 lawsuit by the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, a coalition of advocates, seeking more state money for city schools. As part of an agreement between the city and the state, as much as $385 million of the new money was to go to schools labeled by the state as failing or considered high-need because of poverty and other factors, like the numbers of students receiving special education services. At the briefing, Mr. Klein said he had already corrected the injustices of the past by introducing a new school financing system that apportions money based on similar factors. \u201cWhen people say our high-needs schools are being underfunded, they don\u2019t understand that last year we took a huge step toward solving that problem,\u201d Mr. Klein said. At a news conference on Thursday, Sheldon Silver, the State Assembly speaker, called the chancellor\u2019s comments about Albany\u2019s responsibility for the largest cuts a \u201csmoke screen,\u201d saying: \u201cThe chancellor\u2019s cuts are for one reason and one reason alone, and that is the mayor\u2019s proposed budget contains cuts. Period.\u201d The list of schools hardest hit includes those that are so high-performing or have so few high-need students that they are not eligible for certain pots of the new state money. It also includes new schools that the city considers ineligible because there is too little information to classify them as high-need or failing. City schools officials said that in addition to the 74 hardest-hit schools, more than 400 others would face budget cuts of more than 3 percent if the state does not relax its rules. Helaine Doran, deputy director of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, pointed out that much of the new state money was not restricted to low- and poor-performing schools, saying, \u201cWe brought home the bacon and we got the money.\u201d She called it \u201cabsolutely outrageous\u201d for the city to \u201cjeopardize the particular piece of money\u201d intended to benefit the neediest students. At Stuyvesant, a recent newsletter from the parents\u2019 association noted that in anticipation of budget cuts, the school\u2019s principal, Stanley Teitel, was planning to limit students to seven classes during the fall term.

Meanwhile, reliably red states threaten to turn purple. Trump's odds of a win were spiraling downward days before the 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" recording that surfaced last week and depicted him bragging about his ability to grope women as a perk of his celebrity. Since then, his support has collapsed -- particularly among women. A new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed Clinton with a 9-point lead and a new national Fox poll released Thursday night that had Clinton at 45% and Trump at 38% in a four-way race. In the most stunning development of the week, Trump and Clinton were tied at 26% in ruby-red Utah, with virtually unknown independent candidate Evan McMullin closing in on third place with 22%, according to a survey from Y2 Analytics. \"He's at a point where he's trying to draw an inside straight now by campaigning primarily in Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio and North Carolina,\" said veteran GOP pollster Whit Ayres. \"He is well behind in Pennsylvania; he appears according to the latest polls to be effectively tied in North Carolina and Ohio; and he's behind in Florida.\" \"Donald Trump said he would put new states in play,\" Ayres said, but he noted wryly that he never thought they would be the red states of Utah, Arizona and Georgia. Clinton's campaign has already invested resources in Arizona and is marshaling forces in Georgia as they eye ways to expand the map for down-ballot races. And this is before allegations this week from a growing number of women who have accused him of unwanted sexual advances. Trump has vehemently denied those accusations, and there is no data yet to gauge whether he will suffer further fallout in the polls, but it's another issue that has knocked Trump off-message with time running down before Election Day. \"The map looked strong for Clinton at the start of this race and it's looking even stronger for her toward the end of it,\" Ayres said. \"If a landslide is winning in the Electoral College by more than 100 votes, Clinton is on track to do that now.\" Because of Democrats' advantage in the Electoral College, Trump's path to the White House relied not only on keeping all the states that Mitt Romney won in 2012, but also seizing Democratic turf in states like Pennsylvania. Clinton held a 9-point lead in Pennsylvania, according to a new Bloomberg Politics poll released Thursday. Most striking was her lead in the Philadelphia suburbs -- the place where many strategists believe this race will be won or lost. A startling 56% of suburban Philadelphia voters said they were supporting Clinton, compared to 28% for Trump. Even if Trump were to win the mighty battleground states of North Carolina (where Clinton currently has a 4-point lead), Ohio, Nevada and Florida, he would still fall short of the 270 electoral votes that he needs to win. That means he would have to make up ground in Pennsylvania, Michigan or Wisconsin -- all states where he is trailing far behind her, according to new polls. Democrats have long been confident about their ability to win Colorado, where both Trump and Clinton visited recently And they are increasingly bullish about their chances in Nevada, another state Clinton hit this week. In another blow to Trump's campaign on Thursday, Republican sources confirmed that Trump was pulling his resources from Virginia, a state that has seen a huge influx in the number of foreign-born citizens and large growth among Asians, who have increasingly tilted toward Democrats in recent years. Because of demographic changes in Arizona and Georgia, those two states appear to be closer this year than in 2012 when Romney won them comfortably. Democrats had already made inroads with the large African-American population in Georgia, and been buoyed by the growing Hispanic population in that state. But Clinton has also shown particular strength this cycle among college-educated white women voters in the suburbs of Atlanta. While campaigning in Colorado this week, Clinton urged her supporters to get their friends out to vote in Utah and Arizona. \"We are competing everywhere, and the polls are tightening because I think Americans want a turnout in as big a number as possible to reject the dark and divisive and hateful campaign that is being run by my opponent.\" Many Republican strategists still expect Trump to hold on in Utah and Arizona, even if he loses the race. But Democrats believe they are laying the groundwork for 2020 and beyond. \"In the same way President Obama helped build up registration in the African American community and among millennials, Donald Trump is offering new opportunities for Democrats to make gains,\" said Bill Burton, a former Obama adviser. Burton noted that in California, for example, registration among Latinos has grown exponentially, \"and you're seeing that trend across the country.

She and her parents were at a football game at Washington\u2019s Archbishop Carroll High School, the Catholic boys\u2019 school her brother attended. There at the front of the stands was Kevin, a 10th-grade spectator rallying the crowd in a cheer. He was round-faced and blue-eyed \u2014 the cutest boy she had ever seen. She spotted him again when she tried out for a play at his school the following year. This time he noticed her, too. \u201cI\u2019m gonna take that girl to homecoming,\u201d he told his buddy. He did, but before that he picked her up in his 1964 MG 1100 sedan and drove to a hamburger joint, where they shared a first kiss. The two were an immediate item, driving back and forth to play rehearsals, holding hands at dances and football games. Debi was all sweetness and warmth, from a tightknit family that adored Kevin. The fourth of five siblings, Kevin was a first-rate smart aleck who had developed an armor of bombast. His dad had died when he was 7; his mother became a sometimes-violent alcoholic. By his junior year, he was living mostly in the back of a Washington gas station. Debi was his refuge \u2014 the two never fought. They were soaringly in love and completely devoted to each other. Kevin\u2019s younger sister, Ellen Pino, remembers a day when his car wouldn\u2019t start. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t worried about getting to school.

Her comments could equally apply to a Labour Government if opinion polls showing Ed Miliband\u2019s party being wiped out north of the Border become true and he makes good his promise not to consult the SNP over his Budget or Queen\u2019s Speech. They came as Stewart Hosie, her deputy, suggested a second referendum could be justified if the Government implemented tough spending and welfare cuts and a day after she refused to say whether the renewal of Trident next year would justify another vote. Nicola Sturgeon has warned Ed Miliband he would not get a 'free pass' Ms Sturgeon has repeatedly attempted to reassure voters that backing the SNP next Thursday will not lead to a second referendum, despite some of her candidates saying otherwise. However, for the first time since last year\u2019s 11-point defeat for the separatists, she questioned whether the victor in a UK general election would have a democratic mandate to govern Scotland. \u201cSurely a test of legitimacy that should be applied to whatever Westminster government is formed after this election cannot simply be that it is the largest party in England,\u201d she said. \u201cThe test that must be applied is whether a government can build a majority and win support that reflects the whole of the UK. English MPs will always be the largest part of any Westminster majority, but to ignore Scottish voices would be wrong.\u201d Ms Sturgeon said a minority Labour Government could not assume it had the support of her party\u2019s MPs just because of her \u201ccast-iron commitment\u201d to keep out the Conservatives. She warned Mr Miliband that she would not allow Labour to be a \u201cpaler version of the Tories\u201d and gave the most detailed account yet of how she would use her party\u2019s leverage in a hung parliament to push through a series of Left-wing policies, such as an \u00a38.70 minimum wage. Labour MPs would be faced with a choice of voting with the Tories for cuts or the SNP for the end of austerity, she said. They will also be invited to vote with the Nationalists to stop the renewal of Trident. Earlier, Mr Hosie told BBC Radio Scotland that pressure from Scottish voters for a new referendum would be hard to resist if Westminster failed to accommodate the SNP\u2019s spending plans. A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: \u201cWhoever can command a majority of those members in the House of Commons will be able to form a government regardless of whether they come from Scotland, England, Wales or Northern Ireland. Nobody is being ignored, \u2013 this is the parliamentary system. \"The SNP offered an alternative to this system last year when it put forward independence for Scotland. However, the people of Scotland roundly rejected their proposal and said they wanted to remain part of the United Kingdom. The issue was settled then. It is a pity that Nicola Sturgeon is once again seeking to stir resentment and grievance.\" The No campaign won the referendum by nearly 11 points Willie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, her speech \u201cshows a high degree of arrogance and conceit that the SNP believe they have won the election already before the polls have even opened.

But I was blown away by just how wretchedly awful the cartoon remake \u2013 previewed at Comic-Con and with a limited cinema release on Monday \u2013 is. Director Sam Liu and writer Brian Azzarello have added a half hour of new story on to the beginning of the narrative, in which they methodically turn Batgirl into a clumsy agglomeration of misogynist tropes. Pursued by a creepy stalker mafia tough-guy villain, Batgirl makes amateurish mistake after amateurish mistake, prompting Batman to sneer to her face that the bad guy \u201cled you like a lap dog\u201d. In response, Batgirl whines that Batman doesn\u2019t trust her, has impulsive sex with him, and then indulges in a series of violent emotional tantrums before deciding to retire her Batgirl identity on the grounds that the stress is too much for her. As a bonus, Batman hypocritically lectures her on the dangers of objectification while the bad guy compulsively and smarmily sexualizes her, and the cartoon lingers on a closeup image of her butt when she jogs. Girls aren\u2019t emotionally or mentally tough enough to be heroes, is the message; they\u2019re just too darn emotional. But hey, they look good in those tight costumes, right? Related: Batman's Killing Joke, and its 'edgy' rape storyline, is not a comeback I want to see It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. In theory, the additional Batgirl material was supposed to provide a counterweight to the casual misogyny in The Killing Joke. In Alan Moore\u2019s version, Barbara Gordon, aka Batgirl, is casually shot by the Joker and crippled as a way of tormenting Batman and Barbara\u2019s dad, Commissioner Gordon. Harming women to advance the emotional development of some dude is a wearisome comic-book plot staple, and producer Bruce Timms promised that the cartoon wouldn\u2019t follow that same old script. \u201cWe thought if we were going to expand this to feature length, we didn\u2019t want to just pad out the original story,\u201d Timms said. \u201cSo we took that opportunity to basically tell a Batgirl story, which we don\u2019t often get a chance to do these days. And it was great, because we could spend more time with her as a character and get to understand what she\u2019s all about and how she\u2019s similar to Batman in some ways, and really different in others.\u201d Related: Comic-Con 2016: the good, the bad and the unbearable Perhaps different creators could have managed to craft a non-misogynist Batgirl story, especially if those creators were women. But a big part of the problem is, simply, that this is a Killing Joke adaptation. Superheroes just about never get point-blank shot, the way Barbara does in The Killing Joke. They dodge; they move superfast, they anticipate, they win. The Batgirl in The Killing Joke isn\u2019t a hero, but a victim \u2013 and so, Azzarello and Timms follow along with the original material, and create a costumed hero who shouldn\u2019t really be a hero at all. What kind of superhero would just let herself be shot? An overly emotional, unprepared, semi-incompetent hero, the cartoon creators chorus. Input a misogynist comic, add unimaginative creators \u2013 and presto! A misogynist cartoon. The Killing Joke\u2019s failure was predictable. But it\u2019s still instructive. When critics and fans ask for a black James Bond or cheer on the female Ghostbusters reboot, they\u2019re asking for Hollywood to challenge default racism and sexism. All heroes everywhere aren\u2019t white guys, and the stories we tell should reflect that. But if you\u2019re retelling a racist, sexist story, it\u2019s not always so easy to get that racism and sexism out of the formula. You can see that in the Ghostbusters reboot. As novelist NK Jemisin pointed out in a private Facebook post (quoted with permission), the Ghostbusters are all super-smart scientists \u2026 except for the one black character, Patty (Leslie Jones), who is a street-savvy subway worker. \u201cJones\u2019s character contributed to the team, but she was never fully a part of it,\u201d Jemisin says. And, she adds, with feeling: \u201cShe should\u2019ve been a motherfucking scientist.\u201d In part, the fact that Jones was not allowed to be a scientist is indicative of broad cultural racism; because of longstanding stereotypes, black women are rarely presented as brilliant engineers or physicists. But Ghostbusters also limits Patty\u2019s role because it\u2019s based specifically on the original Ghostbusters. In the 1984 film, the one black man who becomes a Ghostbuster, Winston (Ernie Hudson), is thrown into the team as an afterthought halfway through the film. Winston is a hired hand; the three white Ghostbusters are the core team. Patty isn\u2019t a real Ghostbuster for the same reason that Barbara isn\u2019t a real hero. The original stories were sexist and/or racist, and so the remakes are sexist and/or racist as a way of being true to the franchise. Rebooting stories that are racist and sexist is one way that racist and sexist narratives and ideas get replicated and perpetuated. You can sometimes change the story and make it better \u2013 and then, sometimes, you can\u2019t. The Killing Joke didn\u2019t have to be as wretched in cartoon form as it turned out to be, but remaking it was always going to be a bad idea. Instead, maybe, DC could have done an animated Birds of Prey \u2013 a series in which numerous female superheroes, not least Barbara Gordon, fight crime together without having to ask Batman for permission. Rather than another white-focused 80s reboot, maybe Hollywood could finally get its act together and put out The Last Dragon remake they\u2019ve been promising us. Or possibly, at some point, studios could even hire writers, directors and producers who aren\u2019t white men to tell entirely new stories. I know that\u2019s considered risky. But as The Killing Joke demonstrates, retelling mediocre, sexist stories badly doesn\u2019t always work out so well either.", "summary": "It\u2019s fashionable to update a film or cartoon to account for contemporary mores \u2013 but however well intentioned, the original sexism or racism tends to stick.

Moffett was new to the company, appointed by the government after it seized Freddie Mac in September, and he recalled leaning heavily on Kellermann's 16 years of experience at the firm for guidance. Kellermann, 41, was found dead yesterday morning in his Fairfax County home in an apparent suicide, police said. He left no note, law enforcement sources said, and his motivations were not known. But even if his final act was unrelated to work, his last months were consumed by the mounting stresses at the center of the financial crisis. People who knew him said he was deeply committed to Freddie Mac, just about the only place he'd worked professionally, and its struggles had taken an increasingly visible toll. \"David was engaged in all parts of the company,\" said Moffett, who tapped Kellermann as his chief financial officer before resigning the top post last month. \"The CFO of any company in today's environment is a very stressful job... particularly when you're in a company that's undergoing a tremendous amount of change and uncertainty.\" Kellermann had worked his way up at Freddie Mac from a young financial analyst to one of the mortgage giant's main points of contact with its government overseers. Recently, he'd faced intense pressures dealing with the company's billions of dollars in losses and myriad other accounting and legal issues, refusing to take time off, his colleagues said. \"He endured a tremendous amount of stress over the years... It's been a difficult environment,\" said Peter Federico, Freddie Mac's treasurer and a close friend. The news of Kellermann's death yesterday stunned his colleagues. \"It's one of the things that puts everything in perspective. It's difficult for everybody to deal with it,\" Federico said. Kellermann was found by his wife, Donna, yesterday in the basement of their home in the upscale Hunter Mill Estates subdivision in Vienna, law enforcement sources said. He had hanged himself on a piece of exercise equipment, the sources said. There were no signs of foul play. His body was taken to the office of the medical examiner, who will rule on the cause of death. Soon after Kellermann's death was reported, television trucks pulled up outside his stately brick home and its manicured lawn, beaming the image around the world. Many neighbors were taken aback by the attention given to the apparent suicide. Susan Unger, a neighbor, said she last saw him a few weeks ago working in his yard. She woke up early yesterday morning to the sound of rescue crews arriving. \"They took the stretcher in and brought it out empty, so I thought everything was okay,\" Unger said. \"It's just so sad.... I'm just in total shock.\" The neighbors knew Kellermann mostly as a doting father of a young daughter and meticulous gardener.

Democrats and Republicans agreed that a payroll tax cut needs to be extended for a full year. The House passed a bill to do just that,\" said House Speaker John Boehner. Boehner said the House will vote to disagree with the Senate-backed bill approved Saturday and take their own legislation to conference with Senate negotiators through the regular order of business. But Senate Democrats say Saturday's vote was expected to be the last one of the year, and they have no plans to return to Washington before the next session in January. They add that they considered the Senate bill a bipartisan compromise. It passed 89-10. \"We're not coming back,\" said a Democratic aide. \"They should pass the two-month, and we start negotiating the year-long. Remember, this is the two-month (Republican Leader Mitch) McConnell negotiated.\" However, the Senate has not adjourned for the year, and remains in will be in pro-forma sessions, which are designed to meet the constitutional requirement that if they don't adjourn, they meet every few days. Making a return more complicated is the approval needed from all 100 senators to let the Senate hold any votes before the chamber's late January return. Without congressional action, the payroll tax would rise 2 percentage points on Jan. 1 -- a boost that Democrats eagerly said would be the GOP's fault. The brinksmanship is a familiar pattern this year between the two parties, who have narrowly averted a federal default and several government shutdowns in past fights. Extending the payroll tax cut and jobless benefits have been a cornerstone of President Obama's and congressional Democrats' effort to spur a revival of the flaccid economy. The Senate bill, at a cost of $33 billion, would cut the payroll tax, extend jobless benefits and avoid cuts in Medicare payments to doctors through February. Both sides say they want to renew all three for a full year, but bargainers have so far failed to agree on how to pay for a package that size, which could cost roughly $200 billion. A conference committee is where the House and Senate can blend differences in their respective bills, but lawmakers can't go to conference unless they are appointed by their leaders. The House GOP leadership advised its rank and file on Sunday night to expect \"significant\" votes on Tuesday tied to the payroll tax. The biggest sticking point to House Republicans is the two month extension approved by the Senate compared to a year in their own bill. Attached in the Senate bill was a \"sweetener\" for the GOP, which required the president to sign off on a Keystone XL pipeline plan in 60 days or deem it not in the U.S. interest. Obama had previously said he would make no decision on the Canada-to-Texas pipeline until 2013, allowing him to wait until after next November's elections to choose between two Democratic constituencies: unions favoring the project's thousands of jobs and environmentalists opposed to its potential pollution and massive energy use. Obama initially threatened to kill the payroll tax bill if it included the pipeline language but eventually retreated. However, other sweeteners could be added if the sides did go to conference. Added to the chaos is the complaint from payroll companies, who have already started setting withholding tables for next year. If an agreement can't be resolved by the end of the year, many will get hit with a payroll tax increase on Jan. 1. McConnell offered support for Boehner Sunday. His spokesman, Donald Stewart, said the best way to \"provide certainty for job creators, employees and the long-term unemployed is through regular order\" -- a term used to describe the normal process of negotiations between the House and Senate. \"They passed a bill, we passed a bill, now they have to work out the differences,\" a McConnell aide added on Monday.", "summary": "Congress is edging closer to yet another down-to-the wire showdown as House Republicans shun a bipartisan payroll tax cut bill approved by the Senate and prepare to write a package to please rank-and-file GOP lawmakers clamoring for a more conservative version."}, {"text": "Online gamers may have more to fear than the reaper when it comes to hardcore gamer and rock-and-roll legend Eric Bloom. The lead singer of Blue Oyster Cult has seen his share of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) such as Star Wars: Galaxies, World of Warcraft and, most recently, Warhammer Online. USA TODAY talked with Bloom about his video game experiences. Question: Do you have a particular faction you like to play, whether its the perceived good guys or bad guys in an MMORPG? Bloom: Not really. I don\u2019t know if I am average -- I can only speak for myself -- I play both sides, but not on the same server because you can't. But I just like seeing the different kind of quests, the different kinds of areas. So, I don\u2019t really feel like a huge allegiance to one side or the other. Q: What sort of character classes do you like to play? Bloom: I tend to play a caster in most games I play, so long distance DPS (Damage Per Second) kind of thing. I also play a Bright Wizard, who is a caster, but I play it like an AoE (Area of Effect) kind of player. So, I seem to like that best. Q: What playing style do you enjoy most: questing, raiding, instances or player vs. player? Bloom: All of the above. I like questing, but of course you get to level 40 in Warhammer and unless there is certain kind of gear you want, you sort of do other kinds of quests, a lot of RvR (Realm vs Realm), a lot of scenarios and you are always striving for renown. Q: Is there any aspect of the older, Multi-User Dungeon (MUDs) games that you miss? Bloom: I miss those, and there are plenty of people that I know who left the MUDs to go to the graphic games, but wound up coming back because they missed it. But that hasn't quite happened to me. My analogy has always been that MUDs versus graphic games -- MUDs are actually like listening to a radio drama rather than watching television. It's where the action happens in your head. I know it works that way because I played Gemstone III and IV for many, many years. Even though it would be a paragraph describing the inside of the forest, and you can go north, east, south and west, you actually begin to get some sort of visualization of what the forest is like by reading the paragraph. It's very engrossing and a lot of fun for some people. Q: When you are playing a MMORPG, do you like to keep your celebrity status to yourself? Bloom: There are, sometimes. In this game, I think I have a couple of guildies that know who I am because I got to be friendly with them and I sort of filled them in, but in general most people don't know. I'd say only three or four people might know on my server.

A brief recap for those of you who tuned out after the front-loaded Democratic primaries turned into a long, hard slog. After the New Hampshire results were in, John ''Bring It On!'' Kerry maintained his (professedly unwanted) front-runnership, but Howard ''Yee-haw!'' Dean recovered strongly from his Iowa waker-upper. John ''Two Americas, Count 'Em!'' Edwards and Wesley ''Call Me General'' Clark were nicely positioned for their South Carolina comebacks, and those of us in the pundit dodge began to dream of this dramatic moment. Then came the March 2 ''coastal divide,'' with New York going for Kerry and California for Dean. That split led to this: No more the boring convention with dreary speeches, oleaginous biodocumentaries and unspontaneous demonstrations. Here in Boston tonight, all the world is tuned in as Democratic power brokers wheel and deal in their smoke-free rooms. New Mexico's governor, Bill Richardson, chosen to be permanent chair of the convention to counter Bush's near-amnesty bid for Latino votes, is rapping the gavel.... The dispute within that delegation is between the supporters of Edwards, the ''good young boy,'' and a man dressed in an argyle sweater over a Bosnian uniform waving a Clark sign. Let's turn to the pundit from Black News, the network so lugubriously named when Conrad Black, megamedia's comeback kid, wrested control of Fox News from Rupert Murdoch: ''The fight is over a basket of old Avis buttons because Edwards and Clark are battling for the No. 2 spot on a Kerry or Dean ticket.'' That competition is for the Southernization of any ticket with a New Englander at the top. The general's forces are calling his home state ''Clarkansaw,'' while the youthful trial lawyer's plaintive pitch to be the running mate centers on ''I gave up my Senate seat to run, and now I represent all those folks who really need a job.'' But the V.P. nomination will turn on who can deliver more delegates to the two men in front, neither of whom has the needed 2,162 delegates needed for a majority. First to Kerry headquarters: ''Edwards has more state delegates pledged to him than Clark, and would be more loyal to Kerry than the general, but Clark has more of the P.L.E.O.'s.'' Our acronymic reporter refers to Party Leaders and Elected Officials, unelected delegates who make up 15 percent of the convention. These party hacks are controlled by power brokers whose cellphone numbers I will now punch up. To the Old-Left Liberal P.B.: What say you? ''I'm yanking the chain of my delegates to go for Kerry-Edwards, liberal but not unelectable.'' To the D.N.C., McAuliffe, P.P.I. centrists: Your preference? ''We're happier with Kerry-Clark, because Edwards is a spellbinder who could mount a challenge to the Restoration four years from now.'' What's notable is the absence of any offer by Kerry to Dean, to create a unity ticket \u00e0 la Kennedy-Johnson or Reagan-Bush. To the Dean P.B.: Would Howard consider the role of running mate? ''Never. Edwards and Clark will hold their delegates past the first ballot -- there goes Wyoming, and still no majority -- and we'll start to pick off Kerry delegates on the second.'' What makes you so sure the tide will turn? ''Because we'll threaten to bolt if we don't win, and there would go Kerry's 'electability' argument. If Iraq breaks up next month, or if the market tanks or bin Laden rises again, our independent party -- only party that was against the war -- would have a chance to win.'' Or Dean could secretly offer the No. 2 spot to both Clark and Edwards and get their delegates, but then name Kerry, who couldn't refuse if Lieberman gave the double double-cross his blessing. Delicious. But wait -- what's that call booming out over the loudspeakers, reminiscent of the 1940 ''voice from the sewer'' of F.D.R.'s third-term conclave?

Apple\u2019s revenue was $39.19 billion, up from $24.67 billion a year ago. Mr. Cook said that Apple\u2019s quarterly revenue from China was $7.9 billion, about 20 percent of total company revenue. Furthermore, that was triple Apple\u2019s China sales in the same period a year ago. In contrast, Apple\u2019s China sales during its last fiscal year were about 12 percent of total revenue. Two years ago, Apple sales in China were 2 percent. \u201cChina has grown from a rounding error to a massive new market,\u201d said Robert Cihra, an analyst at Evercore Partners. \u201cTheir premium price point clearly has not been any hurdle to them growing there.\u201d Mr. Cook said that enormous numbers of people moving into the middle class in China were creating demand for goods including the iPhone. He said Apple was \u201cdoing everything\u201d it could to serve the market. The iPhone 4S went on sale in China on Jan. 13, near the beginning of the last quarter, and starts at nearly $800 without a wireless plan, though it is available free with a multiyear carrier contract. Since becoming chief executive of Apple last fall, Mr. Cook has repeatedly identified China as one of the biggest growth opportunities for Apple. The growing appetite for Apple\u2019s products among Chinese consumers comes at a time when Apple is working with manufacturing partners and parts suppliers to improve working conditions in factories in countries like China, where most Apple products are made. Apple executives also said demand for the newest version of the iPad, released by Apple last month, was outstripping supply of the product, leading to shortages. They said it remained their fastest-growing business and that Apple had sold 67 million of the device since the first model went on sale in 2010. Mr. Cook said it took 24 years for Apple to sell an equivalent number of Macintosh computers. In the education market, one of the strongest for the Mac, Apple said it sold two iPads for every Apple computer. In one example, the San Diego school district bought 10,000 iPads during the last quarter, with plans to buy 15,000 more in the current quarter, according to Apple. Apple previously told Wall Street to expect earnings of $8.50 a share and revenue of $32.5 billion for the quarter. But as they do nearly every quarter, analysts viewed Apple\u2019s official figures as lowball estimates and came up with their own more bullish forecasts. On average, analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected Apple to report earnings of $10.06 a share and revenue of $36.81 billion for the quarter. Investors in Apple had grown increasingly skittish about Apple\u2019s performance in the weeks before the earnings report, sending its shares down from a high of $636.23 on April 9 to $560.28 at the close of regular trading on Tuesday. Among their chief concerns were research data showing weak sales of the Macintosh computer and worries about whether iPhone sales could keep up their momentum. But immediately after the results from Apple came out, its shares shot up nearly 7.4 percent in extended trading. Even after the jitters of the last several weeks, Apple\u2019s shares are up 38 percent for the year and the company remains the world\u2019s most highly valued company. Some investors fear a repeat of a pattern from last year, when Apple said it lost some sales of the iPhone because of a steady escalation of rumors about the release of a new model. Those rumors were accurate; Apple announced the iPhone 4S in early October. There is widespread speculation that Apple will again introduce a new version of the iPhone in the fall and that consumers might wait for its release so they can get the latest gadget. The iPhone has become an engine of Apple\u2019s growth over the last two years, accounting for almost 40 percent of the company\u2019s revenue during the quarter. Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, said a slowdown in iPhone sales in the months ahead of an expected fall or summer release of a new version remained likely. \u201cYou can count on that,\u201d said Mr. Munster. As it does in most quarters, Apple again tempered expectations with analysts. In the company\u2019s current quarter, Apple said it expected to report earnings of $8.68 a share and revenue of $34 billion. The company also said its hoard of cash and cash equivalents rose to more than $110 billion. Apple has said it intends to slow the growth of its cash through investor dividends and share buybacks.", "summary": "Sales in China helped lift overall iPhone sales by 88 percent over the same quarter a year ago, dispelling fears that sales would lag in nations with lower annual incomes."}, {"text": "Call it a tale of two infections. It\u2019s the story of how hospitals have blocked transmission of a dangerous infection that patients can give doctors, while a hospital-caused infection that can kill patients continues to be widely tolerated. It involves saved lives and endangered ones \u00ad\u2013 and also of billions of dollars spent needlessly due to unsafe care. Photo credit: Marco Longari/AFP/Getty Images The infection that\u2019s been conquered is occupational transmission to doctors and other health care workers of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. When AIDS first burst on the scene in the early 1980s, it was \u201cdisfiguring, debilitating, stigmatizing and inevitably fatal,\u201d in the words of Dr. Paul Volberding, a treatment pioneer. With the disease\u2019s spread poorly understood, \u201cthe fear of contagion [was] hanging over our heads,\u201d Volberding recalled. However, once the mode of transmission was identified\u2013 exposure to HIV-infected blood or other bodily fluids \u2013 precautions were rapidly put into place. From 1985 through 2013, there were just 58 confirmed cases of occupationally acquired HIV infection reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), according to a Jan. 9 CDC report. Since 1999, there\u2019s been only one confirmed case of occupational transmission, involving a lab tech infected via a needle puncture in 2008. Reported occupational infection \u201chas become rare,\u201d the CDC concluded, likely due to prevention strategies and \u201cimproved technologies and training.\u201d At the same time hospitals were eliminating the danger of patients infecting health care workers with HIV, most were doing little to stop the dangerous infections hospitals can give patients. In 1999, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued a landmark report declaring that 44,000 to 98,000 patients died each year from infections and other preventable medical errors in hospitals. This \u201cepidemic,\u201d as the IOM put it, killed more Americans than breast cancer or AIDS. (Later research put the preventable deaths at from 210,000 to more than 400,000 annually.) Yet by 2008, the same year as the last reported occupational exposure to HIV, studies would show that most hospitals had done very little to prevent patient harm. That year, however, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality launched an ambitious effort to fight one particularly expensive and dangerous infection that, like HIV, was extensively studied. It\u2019s called a central-line associated bloodstream infection, or CLABSI. Bloodstream infections from catheters placed deep into a sick patient\u2019s torso have a higher mortality rate than typhoid fever or malaria. They\u2019re also the most costly of healthcare-associated infections, costing an average $46,000 per patient. The good news was that a five-step \u201cchecklist\u201d approach, including such simple items as hand-washing and cleaning the patient\u2019s skin with a disinfectant, was startlingly effective at CLABSI prevention. A study of checklist use in the New England Journal of Medicine documented how a large group of hospitalsreduced CLABSIs by nearly 70 percent in just 18 months. During that brief time, they saved more than 1,500 lives and nearly $200 million, researchers estimated. Many of the hospitals eliminated CLABSIs altogether. So did hospitals everywhere rush to conquer CLABSIs the way they\u2019d triumphed over occupational HIV transmission? Not quite. The latest CDC report, also issued in early January, shows that during the five-year period from 2008 to 2013 CLABSIS declined only 46 percent. What happened?", "summary": "Hospitals have zealously followed the rules that protect doctors and others from being infected by patients with the HIV virus.

Mediaeval accounts refer sporadically to slaves working as household servants, bodyguards, militiamen and sailors in the Persian Gulf including what is today southern Iran. The practice lasted, and evolved, through many centuries. In Iran\u2019s modern history, Africans were integral to elite households. Black men were mostly eunuchs working inside the king\u2019s harem and houses, while black women were servants to Iranian women. Despite its ancient roots, the topic of African slavery is rarely discussed or even acknowledged in Iran. This is partly because there has not been comprehensive research on either African slavery of the subsequent use of African domestic servants. But there are photographs that offer glimpses, and these have been the focus of anthropologist Pedram Khosronejad for the past four years. Khosronejad was recently appointed Farzaneh Family Scholar for Iranian and Persian Gulf Studies, a new programme at the Oklahoma State University. The topic of African slavery in Iran came to his attention in the late 1990s when he was working on a two-year ethnographic project in the Persian Gulf including the cities of Minab, Bandar Lengeh and Bashagard county in Hormozegan province. His studies of the traditional dress of black Iranians led him to the issue of slavery. Later, in 2011, when Khosronejad was organising an event on Qajar photography and cinematography at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, he came across several photographs from the late 19th century of Africans living inside the harem of the monarch Nasser al-Din Shah (1831-1896). Since then Khosronejad has been collecting photos that tell the story of African slaves and modern African domestics in Iran. His research has taken him to Iran, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States, and he has sifted through several private archives including the personal collection of author Farhad Diba in Spain and the Archive of Modern Conflict in Holland Park, London. He has conducted dozens of interviews with Iranians including Haleh Afshar, the Iranian-born British baroness, who had African servants during the early 1950s and 1960s. So far Khosronejad has collected around 400 photos, which he is planning to gather in the first-of-its-kind visual analysis book on African domestic servants in Iran. He is also preparing several related exhibitions around the world. The work is sensitive. \u201cThere are some Qajar families who have issues with the term \u2018slave\u2019,\u201d Khosronejad explains. \u201cThey say what their families had were domestic servants and they were not treated as slaves. This might be correct, but slavery is slavery and we should be able to talk about it openly.\u201d The presentation of these photos is the first step toward what Khosronejad sees as a new methodology in the visual anthropology of modern Iran: \u201cWe have lots of visual materials that have research value. Some of them have been analysed by visual artists or historians but not anthropologists. We need to read these photos as texts and data for anthropological purposes.\u201d As part of his responsibilities at Oklahoma State University, Khosronejad and his team are developing a methodology for assessing photos and documentary films from an anthropological standpoint. \u201cThese visual materials bear information that cannot be found in texts,\u201d he says. \u201cAnalysing them can help anthropologists advance their studies on Iran.\u201d Captions by Pedram Khosronejad.

(REUTERS/Yuri Gripas) The high-profile U.S.-Africa summit held last week in Washington is raising concerns among advocacy groups, given the red-carpet treatment for leaders with troubling records and the summit's relatively minor focus on human rights. The White House, which hosted the event, is pushing to hold the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit every four years, describing it as a success. It was promoted as the largest-ever gathering of African heads of state at the White House with over 50 countries represented. But while some of the continent's most brutal dictators, like Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, were intentionally not invited by President Obama, the human rights records of some of the others in attendance are hardly stellar. The attendance of South Sudan\u2019s president, Salva Kiir, at the summit raised particular concern, with both pro- and anti-government protests in Washington during the summit. - Jimmy Mulla, Voices for Sudan \u201cThe White House made a mistake with the invitation to President Kiir at the summit given his role in the violence plaguing South Sudan,\" Jimmy Mulla, president of Voices for Sudan, said in a written statement. \"The population and the country would be better served if the government and the opposition groups are all stationed in the region and focused on the peace negotiations.\" South Sudan -- which has been an independent nation since 2011 -- has seen a large increase in conflict with neighboring Sudan and within its own borders. Kiir has helped to fan the flames of conflict by taking aggressive actions against the political opposition. Ten-thousand people have been killed in the nation since fighting broke out between Kiir's forces and opposition forces led by Riek Macher, a longtime rival of the president. The country is also facing famine, and a ceasefire between the two groups collapsed for a second time since January with both sides unable to come to terms on forming an interim government. \u201cFor the majority who want to see peace in the country, the timing was not right,\u201d Mulla told FoxNews.com. \u201cIn countries where there is conflict such as South Sudan, the embattled president sees this invitation as vindication of his position and an opportunity to promote his image internationally and back at home.\u201d Kiir wasn't the only attendee to raise eyebrows. Some of the other state leaders with a questionable rights record include: According to an article on Advocate.com, gay rights supporters are trying to find out whether gay rights were discussed in any depth at the summit, amid concerns about other African leaders' record on that front. The summit was largely used to tackle economic and security and governance issues. \"We are here to take action -- concrete steps to build on Africa's progress and forge the partnerships of equals that we seek, tangible steps to deliver more prosperity, more security, and more justice to our citizens,\" Obama said at the gathering. But some find the lack of discussion on human right violations at the summit troubling. \u201cThere\u2019s been a little bit of push-back,\u201d Cameron Hudson, director of the Center for the Prevention of Genocide at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and a former director for African Affairs for the National Security Council, told FoxNews.com. \u201cAn even bigger pushback was that human rights issues were ignored and that\u2019s what got people riled up.\u201d Hudson adds that the lack of discussion about human rights issues may have been an attempt to squash past criticism, as it was established by the White House that there would be no individual meetings between Obama and any of the African leaders. \u201cThe White House decided very early on that they weren\u2019t going to have any bilateral meetings,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to have a human rights discussion at a table of 30-40 leaders. Those types of discussions are best one-on-one.\u201d \u201cThe president has been criticized in the past, especially by Africans, as being too preachy regarding issues there,\u201d Hudson added. \u201cSo this might have been attempt for course correction, but it was a missed opportunity....

This is a massive data set: more than 500 million Tweets are sent daily. The grand research experiment will visualize how information spreads. The results will show up as both data visualizations and as mobile apps to \u201ccreate new forms of public communication and social organization.\u201d Oh, and by the way, there will be at least five more projects like this, as part of the Twitter Data Grants program. \u201cTo date, it has been challenging for researchers outside the company who are tackling big questions to collaborate with us to access our public, historical data,\u201d notes Twitter in its description of the initiative. \u201cOur Data Grants program aims to change that by connecting research institutions and academics with the data they need. But you probably don\u2019t even care because, you know, this stuff is public, right? Plus you probably forgot about some random comment you made, what, five years ago. Perhaps that\u2019s why the Twitter disclosure got very minimal media coverage, at least so far. Meanwhile, Facebook kind of sort of apologized for the experiment it was caught conducting in June: one in which it basically replaced adjectives in newsfeeds to play with visitors\u2019 emotions. It actually published the results of that study early this year so other data scientists could learn from it. \u201cAlthough this subject matter was important to research, we were unprepared for the reaction the paper received when it was published and have taken to hear the comments and criticism,\u201d writes Facebook CTO Michael Schroepfer in a blog post. \u201cIt is clear now that there are things we should have done differently.\u201d What is the result of this lesson? Tighter research guidelines, data ethics training, and a review board made up of senior executives. By the way, Reuters reported on Friday that one of Facebook\u2019s next experiments will focus on how the social network can play a role in health care. As in, how member communities can help one another with chronic disease management or in spreading the word for important causes, such as why it\u2019s good to sign up as an organ donor. During a Fortune Brainstorm Tech event this week focused on marketing technologies, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg professed her confidence that members are OK with being data guinea pigs, which will keep them from fleeing to competitors like Ello. \u201cPeople will continue to use Facebook if they understand that we don\u2019t tell who they are to anyone, if they understand that they have control over what they share, and if we build a great product that continues to connect,\u201d she said. I\u2019ll buy the notion that people will share information, if it results in some tangible benefit that appeals to their self-interest. But the perpetual stream of cyberbreaches at high-profile brands like JPMorgan, Home Depot, and Target has most otherwise blas\u00e9 consumers paying far more attention to privacy than in the past. There\u2019s a lesson here for Fortune 500 companies defining data analytics policies: make sure your scientists get some ethics training because if/when a breach happens things the disclosure process will be far more straightforward. In my mind, Google is no angel when it comes to manipulating data, but at Fortune\u2019s dinner earlier this week, senior marketing executive Lorraine Twohill described the digital data privacy and \u201cownership\u201d policy most people want to hear: \u201cThe consumer owns the data, that\u2019s why I think controls are so important.

And as one commentator quipped: they aren\u2019t doing it because they expect to be lowering people\u2019s premiums. Traditionally in the individual market, where people buy their own (i.e., non-group) health coverage, applicants sign a contract and the insurance company guarantees that premium for a year. I\u2019m told that about 12 percent of individual applicants would write a check for the year\u2019s premium, rather than being billed monthly. No more. Health insurers started sending out notices in January informing insurance brokers and agents that the companies will no longer guarantee that premium rate. From now on it\u2019s month to month. As one benefits company explained: \u201cAfter carefully evaluating its individual market and rates, Aetna decided to discontinue its offer of an initial 12-month rate guarantee. \u201cThis change applies to policies with a January 15, 2013 or later effective date, in all states where plans are sold. \u201cExisting members who are currently in a rate guarantee period will not be affected. The rate guarantee language has been removed from all marketing materials including the state-specific booklets and rate sheets.\u201d (Update: the day after this column appeared Aetna published a notice saying in part, \u201cWhile the policies will not have a 12-month rate guarantee, we fully expect the rates to stay the same until December 31, 2013.\u201d While that announcement may alleviate the concerns of some, Aetna is not the only company ending the rate guarantee. And come 2014 all bets are off.) Thus, an individual buying health insurance for his family thinking he can afford the coverage might be forced to cancel it within a few months because of premium increases. Why the change? It is all the uncertainty imposed by the misnamed Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare. It has thrown so many unknowns into the mix that actuaries don\u2019t know how much to charge. As one health insurance broker told me, \u201cAny health insurance actuary would be fired for trying to set a premium for a whole year because no one knows how much it\u2019s going to cost.\u201d Why the uncertainty? Because Democrats crafting ObamaCare ignored virtually every actuarial principle. ObamaCare requires insurers to accept anyone who applies; they can\u2019t charge more for major medical conditions; and they require insurance to cover lots of things that many people wouldn\u2019t choose for themselves. As retired actuary Mark Litow and I have written elsewhere, health insurance premiums in the individual market will double for some people in some states\u2014and that\u2019s only in the near term. Now, contrast health insurance with the life insurance market, where people also buy their own policies. There you can buy a policy with a level premium for five or 10 years or more. Of course, one reason that market is so stable is that President Obama hasn\u2019t tried to fix it. Moreover, these premium fluctuations will wreak havoc on the government\u2019s efforts to provide subsidies to families with incomes up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level. The subsidies cover a portion of the cost of health insurance, up to a maximum out of pocket for the family. The amount of the subsidy is based both on the cost of coverage and income\u2014which will lead to an IRS heyday of snooping, but that\u2019s a topic for another day. There has been a lot of head scratching over how to deal with the fact that a family\u2019s income can vary significantly within a year, up or down, in ways no one predicted at the beginning of the year. So how does the government determine the correct level of subsidy? Now add to that mix that premiums can also vary significantly\u2014though only going up, not down. And if you think this is all someone else\u2019s problem because you have good employer-based coverage, you may be in for a surprise. While the individual market has been relatively small (about 19 million people, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute) compared to those with employer-based coverage (about 156 million), most honest analysts expect millions of employers to drop coverage and dump their employees into the individual market. Economic and political uncertainty stifled the economy in Obama\u2019s first four years; but that uncertainty pales when it comes to the uncertainty being experienced in the health insurance market. Millions of Americans will soon discover that health coverage was never so expensive as when Obama decided to make it affordable.

Fish, 29, moved gingerly between points throughout the final hour but was mobile enough during one to engage Tsonga in a double-digit rally in which they exchanged six reflex volleys before Fish hit a backhand long. \u201cIt was unusually cold,\u201d Fish said. \u201cFor whatever reason \u2014 old age, I guess \u2014 my body didn\u2019t check up like I had hoped. Look, that\u2019s not why I lost. But it would have been nice to be able to run without pain.\u201d Thunderstorms had been forecast for the afternoon, and after the fourth set, Fish could have been forgiven for doing a rain dance. But he said his goal was to finish. \u201cWe\u2019re that far into it,\u201d he said. \u201cMy body probably could have handled an extra night of sleep. But we wanted to finish.\u201d In the fifth set, Fish\u2019s mental focus was like cellphone reception on the grounds. It faded in and out. As the players changed sides after the first game, he complained to the chair umpire, using blue language, about the decorum of somebody in Tsonga\u2019s guest box. Tsonga was so focused, he said he did not hear anything but the sound of the ball coming off Fish\u2019s racket. \u201cI did a great job today,\u201d Tsonga said. \u201cI was mentally strong.\u201d Tsonga had reason to feel confident when he was able to force a fifth set. His career record in five-set matches was 6-2. Fish\u2019s was 8-8. \u201cYou start a fifth set, it\u2019s anybody\u2019s ballgame,\u201d Fish said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a great spot to be in, a pretty good spot. We both knew it. He picked up his game better than I did.\u201d Fish staved off three match points on Tsonga\u2019s serve, only to watch Tsonga earn a fourth with a 135-mile-per-hour offering. He capitalized on it with a vicious forehand overhead winner. As the taut drama played out, the crowd in the plaza grew until there were roughly 10,000 people holding night-session tickets to Ashe standing shoulder to shoulder and rooting for Fish, who tried to put a good spin on the loss. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing, no doubt about it,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great player. It\u2019s not a bad loss.\u201d He added, \u201cI can look myself in the mirror.\u201d Fish\u2019s shoulders were slumped as he spoke, the universal language for resignation.

You can call me 'God'.\"\"Hi, God, what's up?\"\"Nothing you need concern yourselves with, but I do have a little something for you.\"\"A gift? From God? What it is?\"\"It's called 'Common Sense', and I give it freely to all of you.\"\"Oh cool! What does it do?\"\"It helps you recognize when something you're about to do, or considering doing is dumb thing. See that fellow over there, the one with the big stick?\"\"Yeah, what about him? He's looking for food.\"\"Yes, but what he doesn't realize is he is about to strike a hornet's nest. Now watch what happens when his Common Sense kicks in.\"\"Oh, wow, he didn't hit the hornet's nest with the stick.\"\"Yes, because that would be, what?\"\"A... dumb thing to do?\"\"Very good. Now you all be sure to listen to your Common Sense, it will save you a few thousand years of strife.\"\"Thanks God, that will come in handy. Oh, hey God, can I ask you a question?\"\"Sure, though you just did, but that's ok. I'll even answer your next question, which will be: 'What should we do about you, God?' Well, the answer is simple - Use your Common Sense. If you want to worship me, that's fine. If you don't, that's fine too, after all I made you so you could think for yourselves, and as long as you're doing your own thinking, then I'm perfectly happy to sit back and watch.\"\"Oh, ok, we can do that.\"\"Oh, hey, God?\"\"Yes?\"\"Why did you create us anyways?\"\"Well, the simple answer is, because I can, but beyond that, look around at this world where you live. It has everything you'll need to survive and grow, and develop into what I already know you can be. It's not quite perfect though - and it will need someone to look after it. Now what you don't yet realize is, this world is just one of many, and while I like to keep my planets all looking nice and operating efficiently, there is only one of me, and that's where you come in - you can take care of this planet where you live and enjoy it for, well, a very long time.\"\"That doesn't sound too difficult.\"\"It's not supposed to be, but every once in a while you little meaty things surprise even me. For example, this isn't the first planet in this solar system that I created life on, but...\"\"But?\"\"Well, I don't like to talk much about it. Let's just say they didn't respect what they had, and that made me feel like they didn't respect themselves, and by proxy, they didn't respect me.\"\"What happened to them?\"\"Let's just say, they're not around any more. They kept fighting among themselves, creating new rules for some of them, while those who made the rules felt they were above them, everybody was miserable, and then they started blaming me every time something went wrong with one of their brilliant ideas...\". At this point, God shook his head, and pressed his fingers aside his temples. \"God, is something wrong?\"\"Not yet.\"\"What do you mean, not yet?\"\"I mean, not yet. But something will go wrong.

Do you see that animal over there?\"\"The deer?\"\"Sure, the deer, as you call it.\"\"What about it, God?\"\"Just watch it. Isn't it nice to see how it moves, how it picks choice bits to eat, and how it communicates with other deer in the area?\"\"I suppose so.\"\"Now you there, draw a picture of a deer.\"\"Me?

Maybe it was a shot I'd taken that morning at Chris Berman or Dick Vitale or George Michael or Ken Beatrice, all frequent targets over the years. But on this day, we'll set aside an assassin's verbal daggers and try to accentuate the positive. This wouldn't be a fitting farewell column without mentioning some of the more important people in my life at The Washington Post, starting with Martie Zad, the lovingly combustible and multitasking sports editor who took a chance on a 22-year-old kid fresh out of Missouri's graduate school of journalism. He also assigned me a desk not far from Bill Gildea and Ken Denlinger, the best possible writing and reporting role models for all my working life and more important, still treasured friends. Of course, the hire had to be approved by Ben Bradlee, the greatest editor of his generation, and, I eventually discovered, among the most ardent followers of the Washington Redskins, my first big-time beat when I covered the George Allen teams of the 1970s. Bradlee's unwavering support when Allen occasionally threatened to throw me out of Redskins Park, even as Watergate was consuming his own life, will never be forgotten. Nor will Shirley Povich, The Post's legendary sports columnist all those mornings who also had to sign off on my employment. A man who had been a Washington must-read institution since the 1920s nevertheless always had the time to offer a word of encouragement, a bit of advice, a better way to say it. The greatest honor and one of the proudest accomplishments of my career was writing Shirley's obituary in advance of his death in 1998 at the age of 92. It was a piece I never, ever wanted to see in print. The man who assigned me that task was George Solomon, the paper's longtime sports editor and my immediate superior when I left the full-time writing life myself in 1979 to join the paper's editing ranks for a dozen years. In addition to having a great eye for talent and producing the finest sports section in America, George eventually allowed me to go back to my first love, writing and reporting, in 1991, and offered me three of the best assignments sportswriter could ever ask for - covering the national NFL beat and professional golf and the weekly Sports Waves column for most of the past 20 years. Many thanks George, for your passion, your guidance and your friendship. There are far too many more to acknowledge and to thank in this modest space, from so many friends inside and outside the newsroom, coaches and athletes, team owners and league officials, network executives and all the people in front of and behind the cameras. And of course, a special thanks as well, to my wife and children, for putting up with the all-consuming deadlines and far too many days on the road, in press boxes on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's, in media tents on birthdays and anniversaries. And now, back to the sports media business. I first started occasionally covering it back in the early 1980s, at about the same time ESPN had roughly 16 viewers, most of them Chris Berman's relatives. The Big Three networks (NBC, ABC and CBS) , not cable television, ruled the sports television business. Obviously, that's no longer the case, though we are still fortunate that many of the mega-events on the crammed sports calendar - Super Bowls, Olympics and the major championships in golf - are still available on free, over-the-air television, including another relatively new network player, Fox. How long that will last is anyone's guess, though I suspect by the end of the decade, watching some or all of the above will also include a price tag. Over the years, I've also written about some memorable broadcasting moments. I was prepared to do a TV column for the Wednesday paper on the opening Monday night game of the 1983 NFL season between the Redskins and Cowboys, at least until Howard Cosell described elusive Washington wide receiver Alvin Garrett, an African American, as \"that little monkey\" after a particularly splendid catch and run.

Ai Weiwei with his sunflower seeds in Tate Modern's Turbine Hall. Photograph: Fiona Hanson/PA At first sight Ai Weiwei's installation Sunflower Seeds presents us with an undifferentiated field of grey, filling the space between the bridge and the end wall of Tate Modern's Turbine Hall. It is almost disappointing. The late Felix Gonzalez-Torres's piles of cellophane-wrapped sweets, which he showed in the 1980s, were prettier, and you were free to eat them (the American artist liked the idea that people could leave his shows with a nice taste lingering in their mouths). But the sweets were also metaphors for the Aids crisis, and much besides. Nothing in art is what it seems. And you can't eat a single one of Ai Weiwei's sunflower seeds, any more than you could Marcel Duchamp's marble sugar cubes. They'd break your teeth. But you can trudge over them, walk or skip or dance on these seeds, all of them Made in China. Or scoop up handfuls and let them run through your fingers, in the knowledge that someone, an old lady or a small-town teenager in Jingdezhen, has delicately picked up each one and anointed it with a small brush. Every seed is painted by hand. The town that once made porcelain for the imperial court has been saved from bankruptcy by making sunflower seeds. It is absurd. I love this work. It is a world in a hundred million objects. It is also a singular statement, in a familiar, minimal form \u2013 like Wolfgang Laib's floor-bound rectangles of yellow pollen, Richard Long's stones or Antony Gormley's fields of thousands of little humanoids. Sunflower Seeds, however, is better. It is audacious, subtle, unexpected but inevitable. It is a work of great simplicity and complexity. Sunflower Seeds refers to everyday life, to hunger (the seeds were a reliable staple during the Cultural Revolution), to collective work, and to an enduring Chinese industry. But it is also symbolic. It joins several previous Turbine Hall commissions \u2013 most recently Doris Salcedo's 2008 Shibboleth and Miroslaw Balka's How It Is \u2013 in a dialogue about the social and cultural place of art. The meanings are as multiple and singular as its form. Ai Weiwei has taken the lesson of Duchamp's readymade and Warhol's multiples and turned them into a lesson in Chinese history and western modernisation, and the price individuals in China pay for that. Every unique seed is homogenised into a sifting mass. Most contemporary Chinese art is a product made for western consumption, just as willow-pattern plates or porcelain vases were shipped out in huge quantities for the western market. Ai is the best artist to have appeared since the Cultural Revolution in China. He has smashed ancient vases, taken a thousand Chinese citizens to a small town in Germany \u2013 his contribution to the five-yearly Documenta contemporary art show in Kassel in 2007 \u2013 made works about the Chinese government's response to the Sichuan earthquake in 2008, and the social crackdowns during the year of the Olympics. Ai takes on the world through an attitude, rather than a style. With his blogs and tweets, he is a constant communicator. However absurd his works might appear to be, he understands the place of the artist, recognising that his work exists in a global world of social, cultural and economic relations. He has a sort of social engagement Duchamp lacked, or couldn't have, and that Warhol dissembled. Ai's field of sunflower seeds is both contemplative and barbed. Generous in spirit, everyone can get it. It will no doubt have a huge audience at Tate Modern, one that might see it as no more than an entertaining spectacle and treat it like a day at the beach. Yet Sunflower Seeds is contingent, oddly moving and beautiful. It is like quicksand.", "summary": "Adrian Searle: Courtesy of Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, the Turbine Hall is now carpeted with a million hand-painted seeds \u2013 an image of globalisation both politically powerful and hauntingly beautiful"}, {"text": "AGAINYE and I met in Ibadan, Nigeria, a metropolis of more than two million people in the southwest part of the country, where he was a graduate student in linguistics and I was on a grant researching Nigerian literature. I knew I was in love when, during a dinner at my house, he recited a poem that he\u2019d jotted down on a scrap of newspaper that ended with the line, \u201cFor winter must not steal a kiss.\u201d And then he kissed me. A few months later, he asked me to go to his village and meet his family for Christmas, and I was thrilled. He said that life there was different, tougher. I told him that I was tough, too. After all, I was from West Texas. After three days of difficult travel heading east across Nigeria in a series of ramshackle buses and vans, Againye and I, seated atop a rickety motorbike for the final leg of our journey, pulled up in front of his family\u2019s homestead: a dirt clearing surrounded by several free-standing tin-roofed clay buildings. A group rushed out to meet us, led by his mother, a petite woman wrapped in blue cloth, who began rubbing her hands together while lifting her head to the sky and speaking rapidly, giving thanks, I supposed, in her Bette language, for our safe arrival. Againye\u2019s village stood at the foot of a series of hills that punched up into mountains at the nearby border with Cameroon. In the evenings, we could see small dots of fires made on the slopes by people who\u2019d decided to stay overnight with their yam crop instead of trekking back to the village to sleep. That first night, Againye and I nestled into each other on the mattress, the only furnishing in his small room, which he had lovingly swept after taking his water bucket back in the palm-leaf enclosure behind the cooking hut. The next morning, still curled up lazily, I watched as Againye dressed himself in black slacks and a blue button-down shirt that his younger brother had pressed the night before with a coal iron. He was traveling to the hospital an hour away to visit his patron, the man who was paying for his graduate school and who had recently become ill. Before going, he kneeled down and gave me a long kiss, pressing his palm against the side of my face, and said those three words that even the most cynical of us long to hear. Trim and preppy, Againye looked like one of those idealized husbands in films, usually too straight-laced to be my type but sexy nonetheless, men who lean down to kiss their beautiful wives before leaving for the office. Except I wasn\u2019t sweet and perfect in a lace nightgown on a four-poster bed, but disheveled in a dirty tank top on an air mattress in the middle of Africa. I was happy. We spent much of the first few days walking in the village. At first, the children were wary of me, staring blankly from doorways, sometimes running away. But eventually they began to follow me in groups, chanting what sounded like, \u201cSpeckengyspeckengy.\u201d When I asked Againye what that meant in Bette, he laughed: \u201cThat means nothing in my language. They\u2019re mimicking you.\u201d In the mornings I watched Againye and his friends playing soccer in front of the dilapidated primary school, a field that would soon be dotted with bovine waste from the annual Christmas cow auction. I loved watching him move. The man had amazing genes: naturally broad shoulders set over a small waist and muscular legs. Quick, lithe, competitive, he challenged the other team with a good-natured roar. In moments like this I felt hypnotized but also uncomfortable \u2014 the woman on the sidelines, the white woman objectifying the body of her black man. But what else do lovers do, I thought. Back at the compound, Againye\u2019s mother was not exactly a warm person \u2014 she\u2019d lived a hard life and showed her love through backbreaking labor in the field with the yams or by preparing huge meals in the thatch-covered fire pit. And although her children were put to work pounding yams, fetching water and shelling beans, she wouldn\u2019t allow me to help.

Related: Sesame Street is moving to HBO for the next five seasons After years of struggling to stay on PBS amid a lack of profitable revenues, Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit educational organization behind the Emmy-winning program, announced it had struck a deal with HBO to move the show over to the premium cable network. PBS was left with a consolation prize: new episodes will continue to air on the channel, but only following a nine-month window. The surprising move was met like a gut punch to many adults who grew up watching the beloved children\u2019s show on the public television provider, and felt dismayed that the show will soon have a paywall, thereby limiting its audience to people who can afford HBO\u2019s monthly dues. The defeated reaction of many caused comedian Brian Gaar\u2019s tweet about the privatization of the show to go viral, immediately following the announcement. Time magazine TV critic James Poniewozik followed suit, saying on Twitter that the move felt wrong. On Friday morning, Poniewozik elaborated on his tweet with a pointed essay on \u201cwhy the Sesame Street deal hurts parents more than kids\u201d. \u201c[A]s Sesame Street has taught for so long, feelings matter too,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd however well the decision works practically, in principle it feels gross.\u201d He concedes that Sesame Workshop are doing the right thing \u201cby finding a way to keep a valuable institution vital\u201d, but said the announcement couldn\u2019t have been more \u201csymbolically freighted\u201d. It\u2019s easy to see his point. Sesame Street was a show created for children in the 1960s to be consumed by everyone, regardless of social standing. The new pact with HBO changes that: only parents willing to pay the costs will be able to show their children the latest episodes. As Washington Post blogger Alyssa Rosenberg said: \u201cFriendly neighbors may still meet on Sesame Street. Now, they\u2019ll just be doing it nine months apart.\u201d Related: 'You know nothing, Jon Elmo': the internet reacts to Sesame Street on HBO Which raises the question: is that gap really worth fretting over? Jeffrey D Dunn, Sesame Workshop\u2019s CEO, says the new partnership represents a \u201ctrue winning public-private partnership model\u201d to provide \u201cSesame Workshop with the critical funding it needs to be able to continue production of Sesame Street and secure its nonprofit mission of helping kids grow smarter, stronger and kinder\u201d. Indeed, the deal will allow Sesame Workshop to produce almost twice as many episodes as previous seasons (35 a year, up from the 18 it produces now), on top of plans to develop a spin-off series, as well as a brand-new original series. In turn, PBS now has more money free for other programming. The partnership is a clear win-win for both HBO and Sesame Workshop. HBO is known for skewing to a mature demographic, with explicit shows like Game of Thrones and Sex and the City. With the launch of HBO Now, the cable network recently entered the streaming world. The new platform now puts HBO in competition with streaming mainstays like Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant Video \u2013 two services that make a huge profit by catering a lot of content to young audiences. Sesame Street will make HBO Now a streaming destination for families. Also working in HBO\u2019s favor: both Amazon and Netflix will no longer be able to air Sesame Street episodes because of the deal. For Sesame Workshop, the partnership will keep the show alive, a matter of paramount importance. Sesame Street has struggled in recent years to acquire the funding it needs to stay on the air, because of the rapid rise of streaming and on-demand viewing and a steep decline in licensing income. To now, the show was largely funded through licensing revenue, such as DVD sales. According to the New York Times, PBS was only responsible for 10% of its budget. Sesame Street\u2019s co-founder Joan Ganz Cooney put it bluntly, saying Sesame Workshop had to \u201cadapt to the times\u201d in order to survive. For those disillusioned by news, there is a silver lining: HBO has only signed on for the next five seasons of Sesame Street. As Rosenberg writes for the Washington Post: \u201cHBO\u2019s contract with Sesame Street simultaneously demonstrates, once again, that the show is a valuable commodity, and makes one of the best, most under-looked arguments for public arts funding.\u201d Here\u2019s hoping the federal government steps back up to the plate.", "summary": "HBO is the new home for Sesame Street from this fall \u2013 but why did the show make the move from PBS, and what does it mean for children and their parents?"}, {"text": "Just to put it in perspective, the last time the UFC brought a fight card to Cincinnati, Kanye West was rhyming about the \u201cGood Life\u201d atop the Billboard Hot 100 and the dangerous, not dreamy vampires in 30 Days of Night top the box office. While it was undoubtedly a long wait, Saturday\u2019s UFC Fight Night proved that it was worth it, as the 13-fight card delivered non-stop action from start to finish. There were plenty of high points worth searching out on UFC Fight Pass in the future, but for now, here\u2019s out look back at the Top 5 Moments from UFC Fight Night: Brown vs. Silva. This is The Hit List. Matt Brown: Master of Violence Some guys are black belts. Some have impressive collegiate wrestling pedigrees. Matt Brown is none of those things. Instead, \u201cThe Immortal\u201d deserves an entirely new distinction: Master of Violence. Returning from a nine-month layoff and riding a six-fight winning streak, the Ohio native had the crowd in Cincinnati on their feet from the outset, surviving a dangerous first two minutes to put a hellacious beating on Erick Silva over the final 10 minutes, finally earning the stoppage just over two minutes into the third frame. There is no let-up with the 33-year-old Brown \u2014 he\u2019s coming forward at all times, throwing everything imaginable at whoever is standing in front of him. Silva caught him with a couple gnarly body shots that had him buckled over in pain, but rather than fold, Brown straightened up and starting coming forward behind punches, kicks, elbows and anything else he could think of throwing. Now having won seven consecutive contests, the former Ultimate Fighter contestant should find himself facing off with one of the top names in the welterweight division next time out. When that happens, you can be sure it will be all kinds of violent. The Urgent Aggression of Costas Philippou Entering on a two-fight losing streak and having most recently been stopped in the first round, Costas Philippou came out of the gate like a man possessed in his co-main event pairing with Lorenz Larkin. Historically a slow starter, the 34-year-old New Yorker (by way of Cyprus) came out swinging right away, trading big shots with Larkin from Jump Street. Both men landed some big shots and opted to keep swinging, but that proved to be a bad decision for \u201cDa Monsoon.\u201d Philippoun uncorked a left hand that staggered Larkin along the cage and followed up with a pinpoint short right on the button that ended the bout in a flash. After a pair of lopsided setbacks had him questioning if he wanted to continue competing, Philippou turned in the best performance of his career, showing that he\u2019s still a threat in the middleweight division. Daron Cruickshank is developing a penchant for delivering highlight reel finishes. Paired off with divisional newcomer and former featherweight title contender Erik Koch, \u201cThe Detroit Superstar\u201d made the most of his first main card opportunity, collecting a stunning first-round finish. A taekwondo stylist who uses his kicks to maintain space like others use a jab, Cruickshank kept Koch at bay early, circling and escaping well and landing with sporadic strikes from odd angles. Midway through the frame, Cruickshank went on the offensive and Koch went down, getting caught with a left head kick that left him on the canvas. The former TUF Live contestant pounced, unloading a barrage of unanswered punches and elbows to force the stoppage. Cruickshank has now won consecutive contests to push his record to 5-2 in the UFC and has established himself as a must-see attraction whenever he steps into the Octagon. Soa Palelei went nearly six years between UFC appearances, but over his last three appearances, \u201cThe Hulk\u201d has been making up for lost time. Entering Saturday\u2019s pairing with newcomer Ruan Potts on a 10-fight winning streak, the final two of which came inside the Octagon, the 36-year-old veteran patiently avoided a couple early submission attempts from the South African. Once Potts stopped attacking from bottom, Palelei began attacking from the top, slipping to mount with ease and finishing \u201cFangzz\u201d with a nasty left hand. Palelei has now won consecutive contests in the opening round and is starting to move from being a fun redemption story into a fringe contender in the heavyweight ranks. Given the overall lack of depth in the division and proven one-punch power he carries to the cage, it\u2019s not inconceivable to think that the Australian heavyweight could find himself in a marquee matchup before the year is out. Three of the opening four bouts on Saturday night came to a close inside of the opening five minutes as Albert Tumenov, Justin Salas, and Johnny Eduardo all collected impressive finishes at U.S. Bank Arena in Cincinnati. Tumenov got things going with a blistering left hand that starched Anthony Lapsley just prior to the four-minute mark of their welterweight affair, earning his first UFC victory with a highlight reel finish. In the very next fight, Salas one-upped the 22-year-old Tumenov, putting Ben Wall on the canvas with a left hand down the middle just passed the midway point of the first stanza. Not to be outdone by the Fight Pass preliminary performers, Eduardo returned off a layoff of more than 700 days to stop former title challenger and Top 5-ranked veteran Eddie Wineland. As two looked to feint and find their range, the Brazilian dropped a beautiful right hand on the chin that gave Wineland the full body wiggles, finishing him off with a follow-up right seconds later to seal the upset.", "summary": "For the first time in seven years, the UFC returned to Cincinnati with an under the radar fight card that delivered tons of action inside the Octagon.

So we welcome the many changes Toyota has made to its perennial best-seller for 2015 (some 2,000 of the car\u2019s 6,000 parts are new), most of which were not made to help customers sleep better at night\u2014the current car does that just fine\u2014but to get customers excited to see one in their driveway when they wake up. So do they? We went to the press launch for the new Camry in Hawaii to find out. First off, what\u2019s this? Is that style? Why, yes. Photos perhaps overemphasize the big grille, but the Camry\u2019s more elegant body\u20141.7 inches longer than last year\u2014impart a sense of grace it hasn\u2019t had since the 1992\u20141996 Camry, which until now has been touted as the best-looking Camry in its 30-year history. Swoopy new headlamps and, on some models, LED hash marks running down their cheeks add a bit of edge. The rear styling is vastly cleaner than before, and includes a tasteful spoiler on certain models. New for \u201915 is an XSE model wearing monochromatic paint, blackout exterior details, and sexy 18-inch wheels (compared to 16-inch steel wheels/covers on LE models and 17-inchers on LE and SE models). If there\u2019s a weak spot in the design, it\u2019s the C-pillar garnish that pretends to be a window but isn\u2019t. All told, while it may not look quite as harmonious as the gorgeous Mazda 6, it\u2019s a huge step away from the contrived styling of the outgoing model and almost approaches beautiful. Nearly every interior surface with which the driver or passengers interact has been changed\u2014nothing as radical as the exterior redo, but the upgrades are welcome. The seats place the driver nice and high, and feature classy contrasting stitching, and a bit more soft (or soft-ish) touch stuff is found on the dash and door panels. Color schemes range from rental-grade grays for the appliance-like LE to sportier and more metallic with the SE to dark and intense with the aforementioned XSE, with its black leatherette/faux suede upholstery and red stitching. The XLE model continues as the most luxurious Camry, with leather seats and faux wood. The latter two models also get rear seat air vents and dual zone climate controls inside, as well as LED low- and high beam headlamps. The gauges are also new, and the touch-screens are larger for the app-based EnTune infotainment systems on XSE and XLE V-6 models (7.0 inches vs 6.1 on the rest), which also get wireless charging ports behind a door in the dashboard for compatible handheld devices. Safety options come in the form of pre-collision system, automatic high beams, and blind spot monitor with rear cross traffic alert. Under the skin, the biggest changes involve retuning the Camry\u2019s shocks and springs for increased responsiveness without killing the creamy ride quality for which the Camry is known. On the mostly benign roads, it proved more responsive to inputs and less tippy in corners than their predecessors, with the XSE model aspiring to be somewhat fun (though, honestly, it doesn\u2019t quite get there). That model\u2019s brakes in particular are beautifully tuned, with crisp initial bite and a linear response. Steering is also better than before, with the XSE model touting the most Germanic feel (i.e.: with a bit of heft and a bit of tactility through the wheel). And all models, including the hybrid, seem even quieter than the cars that came before them. That latter point is no surprise, given the added structural reinforcements and the insulating properties of the soft-touch interior bits. While so much of the Camry is new, the powertrains are pretty much carried over from the outgoing models. The standard 2.5-liter inline four-cylinder makes acceptable power\u2014178 hp and 170 lb-ft of torque\u2014though you\u2019ll need to wind it out pretty good to access it. With 268 hp and 248 lb-ft of torque, the 3.5-liter V-6 available in XLE and XSE models is far more powerful, but its coarseness at high revs makes it none too enjoyable to access that power. Expect the V-6 to hit 60 mph in about 6.5 seconds, with the four-banger taking about a second or longer to do the same trick. Not surprisingly, since nothing has really changed under the hood, EPA fuel economy estimates remain the same as 2014, at 25 mpg city/35 mpg highway for the four-cylinder, and 21/31 for the V-6; hybrid models come in at 43 mpg city/39 highway for the LE trim, and 40/38 for XLE/SE trim levels. At $23,895 and $24,665, respectively, Camry LE and SE models come in at virtually the same price as their predecessors, while the $26,975 XLE brings about $1,200 more equipment into 2015 for just $340 more than before. The XSE is priced exactly the same as the XLE. And as for the hybrid, expect to see MSRPs between $27,615 and $30,805, before options are added. In spite of its innocuous appearance (or perhaps because of it) the Camry has been the best-selling car in America for the last 12 years. Now, after driving the quieter, more comfortable and more elegantly styled 2015 model, we\u2019d say that the Camry\u2019s sales crown seems as secure as ever. And alas, now it has something to offer to stimulate both sides of your brain.", "summary": "Toyota has a well-earned reputation for building reliable, but bland cars that sell fast and in large quantities. But with the new generation of it's best-selling Camry, have they finally added emotion to the mix?"}, {"text": "This one is tougher for me to answer because I did not cover the team until this year. There are obvious schematic differences, such as the change from the pro style to a spread offense and going from a base 4-3 defense to a 3-4. Other than that I could only extrapolate from what I have read, not my own reporting. 2. How would you assess the progress that Seth Collins has made through three games? He clearly established himself as the starter, which was not a given coming into the year. He shared reps with Marcus McMaryion in the first game and won the starting job. McMaryion played a little bit against Michigan but was less effective, and last week was all Collins. He\u2019s obviously a gifted runner (third among QBs in the nation). The team has designed runs for him and he can break out on his own as well. His passing, which was a concern coming out of camp, has been okay. He\u2019s not completing a high percentage of his passes but has only made one critical mistake, an interception deep in his own territory. He still misses on some short and long throws but has also hit on two deep touchdowns and a third that was dropped. Given that, I\u2019d say his arm has been a bit better than expected. 3. Michigan ran well against the Beavers, and Stanford loves to run. Is that an area of vulnerability for OSU? The Michigan game was by far the worst Oregon State looked defending the run and a number of factors could have played into that. One, the Beavers\u2019 offense could not get anything going in the second half. They ran 16 plays for nine yards so the Oregon State defense had little time to rest and clearly wore down. Defensive coordinator Kalani Sitake also said too many defenders were looking for strips instead of wrapping up, which contributed to allowing 225 rushing yards. The staff counted 22 missed tackles. Stanford can run a similar power game so the conventional wisdom seems to be that they can have the same success as Michigan. 4. Rahmel Dockery looks like a very dangerous weapon on returns. How has OSU been in that area so far? Dockery has actually struggled a bit this season, most notably when he muffed a punt return at his own 6-yard line against San Jose State last week. The coaching staff clearly has confidence in him because they put Dockery back out there after the mistake. Field position is at a premium given Oregon State\u2019s offensive efficiency thus far, so the Beavers are going to need more from him to help with that battle. 5. How would you describe the pluses and minuses of Kalani Sitake\u2019s defense so far? The pluses have been its creativity and success on third down. The Beavers switched from a 4-3 to a 3-4 under the new staff, but the staff has mixed in a number of defensive fronts to keep offenses guessing, including the four-man. Sitake has also gotten creative with secondary coverages and blitzing. The Michigan game was an exception, but in games against Weber State and San Jose State, OSU allowed one conversion in 26 third-down attempts. The minuses are pretty much all from the Michigan game when the defense couldn\u2019t stay off the field and the Wolverines ran all over them in the second half. Other than that, the defense has been pretty stellar. Stanford will be a huge test to see how legitimate that success has been.", "summary": "Danny Moran, Oregon State beat writer for The Oregonian, answered our questions about the Beavers, who host Stanford Friday night 1.

Zaharie Ahmad Shah, a host of possible explanations \u2014 and conspiracy theories \u2014 have materialized. Evidence thus far suggests the Boeing 777, which took off on March 8 carrying 239 people on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, was deliberately turned back across Malaysia with its communications systems disabled. Exactly what occurred next \u2014 and why \u2014 remains a mystery. - Al Yurman, former NTSB investigator \u201cNothing is going to be determined as a fact until we either have a wreckage or an airplane,\u201d aviation expert Al Yurman told FoxNews.com. \u201cYou cannot make factual statements in an aircraft accident until you have either of those. What\u2019s happening now is complete speculation; everything\u2019s possible.\u201d Yurman, a former National Transportation Safety Board investigator, said he suspected some kind of criminal activity behind the incident. Shah, the plane\u2019s 53-year-old pilot who has more than 18,000 hours of flight experience, reportedly deleted files containing records of simulations on Feb. 3 and co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid has previously allowed unauthorized people into cockpits, Yurman noted. \u201cSo my first thought was to look into them and their backgrounds,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also had at least two Iranians with false passports. I think they have to look into that more as well.\u201d Investigators poring through Shah\u2019s home flight simulator are likely searching for information related to remote airports where he may have previously practiced landings, Yurman said. Scott Shankland, an American Airlines pilot with experience on Boeing 777s, told The Associated Press that a captain would know how to disable the plane\u2019s tracking systems, but said a hijacker would likely be \u201chunting and pecking\u201d for quite a while. \u201c'Do I pull this switch? Do I pull that?\u2019 You could disable a great deal\u201d of the tracking equipment, Shankland said, \u201cbut possibly not all of it.\u201d John Hansman, an aeronautics professor at MIT, said it\u2019s possible an intruder turned off the plane\u2019s transponders, but added that knowing how to completely shut down other systems and ultimately make a successful, hidden landing would be much more difficult. \u201cIf it was a hijacking, it was probably a hijacking gone bad,\u201d said Hansman, who told The Associated Press he believes a series of malfunctions or even a cabin fire could have incapacitated the pilots, much like the 1999 crash in South Dakota that killed golfer Payne Stewart and five others. Yurman, who investigated that 1999 crash while with the NTSB, quickly discounted that possibility, saying any serious issue with the aircraft would have led to several emergency alerts and a wide field of debris upon any crash. \u201cIf there was a malfunction where the airplane couldn\u2019t fly anymore, you\u2019d ultimately have debris, you\u2019d have a crew giving a mayday, issuing several alerts to get help,\u201d Yurman said. \u201cAnd some of that debris will be seen or show up on land or on water somewhere. The debris field, plus its oil slicks, would be out there more than likely for a long time.\u201d So what happened to Flight 370 and why can\u2019t investigators find it? To Yurman, citing the facts that no wreckage has been found and questions circulating on the crew\u2019s background, the aircraft is \u201cmore than likely\u201d at a remote site to be reused at a later date. If that\u2019s the case, Yurman said the plane would be repainted, given new identifying characteristics and be prepared to fly as a new entity. \u201cIf it was a hijacking, then it was well planned,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had to get the right people onto the flight, it had to be planned in advance, they had to know what they\u2019re going to do with it and where to go.\u201d Other theories as to what happened to Flight 370 include that it flew in another aircraft\u2019s shadow to avoid detection by appearing as a single blip on radar screens. Aviation blogger Keith Ledgerwood wrote he believes the aircraft \u201csnuck out\u201d of the Bay of Bengal by using Singapore Airlines Flight 68 as cover. Yet another theory asserts that the plane could have cracked its lap joints, leading to sudden depressurization and knocking the pilots unconscious. John Cane, an aviation expert and retired Marine, told FoxNews.com he believes a \u201ccriminal act\u201d led to the plane\u2019s disappearance, but stopped short of saying it was likely hijacked to be used later, perhaps as a weapon of mass destruction \u201cThe reason I don\u2019t lean toward it being hijacked and then landed in a foreign country to be used later is that you\u2019ve already advertised that there\u2019s a missing aircraft out there now,\u201d Cane said. \u201cWhy would you allow your potential targets to raise their defenses? That\u2019s not the way terrorists operate.\u201d When pressed to give the likeliest location of the plane more than 10 days after it disappeared, Cane said Flight 370 was either in an ocean or a jungle. \u201cAnd in those two possibilities, it\u2019s like finding a needle in a haystack,\u201d Cane told FoxNews.com. \u201cBut at this point, we can\u2019t take anything off the table.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "summary": "Aircraft from Australia, the U.S. and New Zealand on Wednesday scoured a search area stretching across 117,000 square miles of the Indian Ocean, about 1,600 miles southwest of Perth, on Australia's west coast."}, {"text": "They act on that feeling.

The flood in these countries of battle re-enactments, books, magazines, TV documentaries, movies, PC games, model kits and media stories confirm this. This is not knee-jerk nationalism, for school and university courses, academic papers and conferences echo this as well. Military narrative of recent history \u2013 especially in a fight for survival \u2013 has always been part of the definition of a nation. Years later, we are still learning lessons from both world wars, and that is a good thing. Yes, we have a certain interest, but it is by no means unique. The Second World War was seen as a righteous war, fighting a monstrous tyranny that would have otherwise engulfed us all and killed even more millions than it did. It is still perceived in those terms. But the war taught us other things too \u2013 how to fight and behave as part of a coalition: lessons we still respect today with Nato and the EU. Make no mistake: 1940 did not see Britain alone. The Axis powers were ranged against the British Empire of over 250 million people with the world\u2019s largest war and merchant fleets and control of huge raw material resources. The use of those assets and peoples was a triumph to be celebrated. It reverberates and is still revered throughout today\u2019s Commonwealth and the UN. Nigerians, Pakistanis and Indians are as much part of this heritage as are we. The United Kingdom\u2019s viewpoint of the Second World War is bound to be different because of geography. We can celebrate the triumph of an island nation prevailing in war. For other landlocked countries with their shifting borders, this is less easy. The Germans are less inclined to look back because of the Third Reich. Besides, modern Germany is physically different to the earlier Germanys of the Kaisers, Weimar, Hitler and the divided states of the Cold War. Instead, modern Germans look forward, not back, obsessed as they have to be with their place in Europe. German war memorials, books and analysis tend to be forward-looking because they have to be. Germany as a national unit has always been perceived in the context of wider Europe. Their current angst over Ukraine and Russia is a case in point. The United Kingdom is no more obsessed with war and history than our Teutonic colleagues, but our narratives are different. We look back and celebrate, partly because we can, but also to find lessons for our future. This may seem to exaggerate our interest with past wars, but it is a healthy, benign custom.

The complaints fueled a larger debate, with hearings in Congress and by the FCC, on how much control Internet service providers should have over the flow of data. \"The cable companies see a hammer hovering above their heads and are scrambling to find ways to reduce the appearance of wrongdoing,\" said Ben Scott, head of policy for the public interest group Free Press, which advocates for better oversight of cable operators. He called the plans \"Band-Aids\" on the bigger problem of network capacity, which he said can be solved only by larger investments in the cable companies' networks. Comcast said that on Friday it would begin tests in Chambersburg, Pa., and Warrenton, Va., that would delay traffic for the heaviest users of Internet data without targeting specific software applications. Public interest groups complained in November that Comcast targeted users of BitTorrent, a file-sharing application, by blocking or delaying video and other files exchanged with the technology. Free Press said the practice discriminated against certain content and impeded users from having full access to the Web. FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin has said the commission would announce the results of its review of the complaints by the end of June. Analysts said the test would not differ significantly from Comcast's current network-management practices. The new approach would, however, target a broader range of heavy bandwidth users instead of delaying all traffic using BitTorrent. Roger Entner, a senior vice president at Nielsen IAG, said about 5 to 10 percent of peer-to-peer users -- those who directly exchange files with other users -- gobble up about 50 percent of all Internet bandwidth. \"This is the politically correct version of doing what Comcast had been doing before, though it takes the occasional [peer-to-peer] user off the hook,\" Entner said.

Billionaire Peter Peterson floated the idea of mandatory accounts several years ago. (MORE: A New Idea to Fix the Retirement-Savings Crisis) The Australian system increasingly is being held up as a model for the U.S. In Australia, employers must contribute 9% of pay (rising to 12% in 2020) to every full- or-part-time worker between the ages of 18 and 70. This makes the accounts a little like a traditional pension in that the employer is funding them. But the accounts are owned and managed by individuals, as with a 401(k). The Australian \u201csuperannuation\u201d accounts were put in place just 20 years ago and have all but solved that country\u2019s retirement savings crisis. Fink believes something similar would work in U.S. too. He suggests that employer contributions to these accounts be phased in over time, as they have been in Australia. It\u2019s not clear if such accounts would replace the 401(k), be made part of the 401(k) or be in addition to the 401(k). It\u2019s also not clear if employees would be required to contribute to them. Fink says individuals might be asked to contribute some part of their income, possibly 3% to 5%, but that any employee requirement would best be contemplated in the context of a total retirement system overhaul. Commenting on the Australian model, Fink said: \u201cSuperannuation has been a huge success in supplementing the government pension scheme and taking the strain off it, an attractive prospect as we think about how to relieve the burden on Social Security in this country.

Abortion presents a conundrum for most thinking people, regardless of whether they are pro choice or anti-abortion. It's hard to dismiss it as an issue, though, if one believes, as I do and as many on both sides do, that abortion is a matter of morality. As Barack Obama has said, \"There is a moral dimension to abortion, which I think that all too often those of us who are pro choice have not talked about.\" Christians, and people of all faiths and no faith, need to consider whether their positions on the issue of abortion are moral. They should examine their morals and values and decide where there priorities are. They should also decide whether their views on abortion are best represented by Obama and Joe Biden or John McCain and Sarah Palin. McCain and Palin are pro life and committed Christians. McCain says he believes that life begins at conception and that abortion is murder. So does Palin. McCain, however, is in favor of allowing an abortion if a child is conceived by rape or incest. Murder is acceptable, in other words, if rape or incest are the cause of the pregnancy. But does McCain then believe that one could murder a child in infancy if the child had been conceived by rape or incest? What's the cutoff age for killing someone conceived under those circumstances? Three years old? 24? 86? His position raises the question. Palin is more consistent. She is against abortion under any circumstances other than to save the life of the mother. Like McCain, Palin is in favor of the death penalty. In fact, she has said that if the legislature were to pass a bill establishing a death penalty for adults who murder children, she would sign it. So, if abortion is murder -- and the murder of a child -- would Palin and McCain be in favor of executing doctors who perform abortions, or mothers who have them? McCain now supports overturning Roe vs. Wade, a change from his position in 2000, when he lost the Republican presidential nomination to George Bush. At the time, he was opposed to repealing Roe because it would force women in America to undergo illegal and dangerous operations. Sarah Palin also wants Roe vs Wade overturned. The Republican platform on which they are running calls for a constitutional amendment banning abortion. These are serious and important questions because it will be John McCain and -- given his age and previous health problems -- perhaps Sarah Palin who would presumably appoint the next several Supreme Court justices if they win the election. The Supreme Court will decide whether Roe vs Wade will be overturned. McCain has promised, if elected, to appoint Justices like John Roberts Jr., Samual Alito and Antonin Scalia, all of whom have questioned Roe vs. Wade. Recently, a number of Catholic bishops have criticized Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden, a Catholic, for his position on abortion. Biden has said, \"I'm prepared as a matter of faith, to accept that life begins at conception,\" but, he said, \"for me to impose that judgment on others is inappropriate in a pluralistic society.\" Archbishop Donald Wuerl disagreed. \"When life begins is not a matter of faith, but a matter of science,\" he said. \"Defense of innocent human life is not an imposition of personal religious conviction but an act of justice.\" Both Obama and Biden support Roe vs Wade. The decision, Biden has said,\"is as close as we are going to be able to get as a society\" to incorporating diverging religious views on the abortion issue. Those who believe that it is up to a woman to choose what will happen to her body also believe the decision is always difficult. I don't know anyone who is literally \"pro\" abortion. Medical science has made it possible to keep very early fetuses alive, regardless of the quality of life. Everyone who is pro choice struggles with the idea of when life begins. I have total respect for those who believe that life begins at conception. I do not. My belief is that when a fetus is viable, when it can survive on its own, then it is a human being. My beliefs are based, not on religion, but on my own sense of morality. I do not want others imposing their religious beliefs on me. I would be happier if there were no need for abortion. But there are too many women, who, for a myriad number of reasons are not prepared to be mothers and should not be forced to be. They should not be considered criminals if they want to terminate their pregnancies. It was interesting to note Palin's comment on how proud she was of her pregnant daughter's decision to keep her baby. If Palin were in charge, though, her daughter would not have had the option to make that decision. The state would have made it for her. The fact is that women are going to have abortions no matter what the laws say. If abortion is banned it is the poorest women and the youngest who will suffer the most. It is they who will suffer the life threatening abortions in the back rooms of quack doctors and the use of coat hangers to abort themselves. I was there. McCain was there. I saw it. So did he. Which is why, in 2000, he was against overturning Roe vs Wade to avoid those \"illegal and dangerous operations.\" Is it really possible that he changed his position on such an important moral issue simply to get elected President?", "summary": "On Faith is an innovative, provocative conversation on all aspects of religion with best selling author Jon Meacham of Newsweek and Sally Quinn of The Washington Post. Keep up-to-date on global religious developments with On Faith."}, {"text": "Curiously, this strategy appears to have brought in new viewers. After being held out of the NBC fall lineup (in spite of its four Emmy nominations last year), \"Scrubs\" returned in January, and in its first weeks had some of its highest ratings, averaging nearly 8 million viewers on Tuesday nights. And now against the daunting challenge of \"American Idol,\" it has managed to maintain numbers comparable to last season. Not exactly blockbuster numbers, but considering NBC's last-place status (\"Deal or No Deal\" is its only show in the Nielsen Top 10), more than enough to be considered a success. More importantly, \"Scrubs\" scores extremely well with viewers 18 to 49, whom advertisers most desire. The show's producers were also among the first to embrace and cater to an ever-growing online fan base, keeping in touch with Internet chat rooms, providing extensive behind-the-scenes video blogs and Web-only audio commentaries, and offering episodes on iTunes. \" 'Scrubs' is a show that was somewhat ahead of its time,\" said Kevin Reilly, president of NBC Entertainment, pointing out that when the show made its debut in October 2001, NBC (then programmed by Jeff Zucker) was still on top with its \"Must-See\" generation of sitcoms like \"Friends\" and \"Frasier.\" As much as the network executives liked it, \"Scrubs\" had a hard time fitting in. \"There were very few other single-camera comedies when it started,\" Mr. Reilly said. \"And the show has always played by its own rhythm. It's both hugely broad and strangely intellectual at times. It can be sublime, but it doesn't neatly fit into a comfortable little box. It didn't explode in the ratings right away and in NBC's attempt to find the right spot, it ended up getting moved around a lot over the years.\" To complicate matters, \"Scrubs\" is one of the increasingly rare shows not owned by the network that broadcasts it. ABC/Touchstone, where Mr. Lawrence had a long-standing development deal, developed, produces and owns \"Scrubs,\" meaning that NBC's only revenues come from advertising sales. All the auxiliary income, such as DVD sales or syndication fees, goes to ABC. \"Scrubs\" needed to be a big ratings success compared with other, NBC-owned shows, for the network to have financial incentive to keep it on the air. \"As much as I complained about the way they treated us the first few years, I kind of sympathize with their situation,\" Mr. Lawrence said. \"If they had a choice between protecting 'Scrubs' or taking a chance on a new show that they owned 100 percent and whose success might save their jobs, that's a no-brainer. I understand that.\" But once NBC went to the bottom of the ratings heap, it needed to hold on to as many well-reviewed shows as it could, even if they weren't broad-based hits. Trying to regain a foothold, NBC has turned to off-kilter, single-camera comedies like \"My Name Is Earl\" and \"The Office,\" shows that are getting attention for the kind of stylistic risks that \"Scrubs\" has been taking since 2001. After all those years of being the lovable but slightly peculiar stepchild of NBC's comedy lineup, \"Scrubs\" doesn't seem so out of place anymore. \"Television is such an odd, trend-following business,\" said Mr. Lawrence, who was a creator of \"Spin City,\" a more traditional live-audience sitcom. \"When we were trying to sell this show, no one wanted a single-camera comedy. They didn't think they were funny. Now single-camera comedies are what everyone is talking about. And I would bet that the next comedy to really make it big will be one that bucks that trend and is a really well-written multi-camera sitcom.\" Mr. Lawrence says that waiting until January to begin this year's episodes, away from the clutter of all the other fall premieres, helped his show succeed. Coming into this season, almost certain it would be his last, Mr. Lawrence had started writing series-finale storylines including Dr. Perry Cox (played by John C. McGinley) descending into alcoholism and the contentious-but-loving married couple, Dr. Chris Turk (Donald Faison) and Nurse Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes), finally having a child. Those story arcs have remained in place but others have been adjusted or eliminated based on the increasing likelihood that \"Scrubs\" will return for a sixth season. Even though license fees will increase dramatically, Mr. Reilly has said he very much wants \"Scrubs\" to return to NBC next year. And if he changes his mind, Steve McPherson, who was instrumental in developing the show when he was at Touchstone and who is now president of ABC Entertainment, seems more than ready to grab the show for his network. \"I love the show and we could totally find a place for it on ABC,\" Mr. McPherson said in a telephone interview. \"But I can't imagine NBC letting it go.\" Mr. Lawrence believes that, intentionally or not, \"Scrubs\" may have found the blueprint for future television success. Gigantic hits marketed to broad audiences, he said, are increasingly rare. Ratings behemoths like \"American Idol\" are the exception, not the rule. \"If you don't start out as the most prominent show on the network, with huge ratings right off the bat,\" he said, \"you have to readjust yourself almost immediately to say, 'Who is our core audience and what are they responding to?' \" \"It's like politicians deciding to play to their core constituencies,\" he said. \"A competently made, middle of the road show, which used to be the network model, isn't going to generate that level of passion,\" he said. \"So you have to do what we've done, what I think 'My Name Is Earl' and 'The Office' have done, which is to write a show so quirky and so specific that you're acknowledging right out of the gate that it's not going to have universal appeal. But for the people it does appeal to, it's going to have an iron-clad grip.\"", "summary": "Article describes television show Scrubs, which has received excellent reviews but only mediocre ratings; current season is thick with inside jokes, psychotic monologues and bizarre secondary characters; change has increased ratings and brought in new viewers; photos (L)"}, {"text": "{ \"movie\":\"http://media10.washingtonpost.com/wp/swf/OmniPlayer.swf\", \"id\":\"oplayer-video-swf\", \"width\":\"100%\", height:\"100%\", \"vars\":{ \"title\":\"Boehner, Cantor: GOP seeking \\'results\\'\", \"stillURL\":\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/photo/2010/11/03/PH2010110303861.jpg\", \"mediaQueryString\":\"http://static.washingtonpost.com/wp/swf/OmniPlayer.swf?id=11032010-38v&flvURL=/media/2010/11/03/11032010-38v.m4v&playAds=true&adZone=wpni.video.ap&canShare=true&jsonURL=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.washingtonpost.com%2Fmedia%2Fmeta%2F2010%2F11%2F03%2F11032010-38v.jsn\" }, \"params\":{ \"allowFullScreen\":\"true\" } } Talking with '127 Hours' director Danny Boyle Election night in 90 seconds Obama takes responsibility for voter frustration Football Insider Live: Ripple effects of benching McNabb Voters to Washington: It's time for more change Boehner, Cantor: GOP seeking 'results' Paul supporters revel in Tea Party victory Boxer fights back Fiorina, wins fourth term Reid survives scare, defeats Angle in Nevada Jerry Brown elected Calif.

The bad news is it was a dissent, from a decision upholding new Federal Communications Commission regulations that are already stifling internet investment, innovation and competition. The 184-page ruling by two Democrat-appointed judges is a sobering read for technologists and internet users. \u201cWe do not inquire as to whether the agency\u2019s decision is wise as a policy matter,\u201d they admit. They stress the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201chighly deferential standard\u201d for reviewing supposedly independent and expert regulatory agencies. Judge Williams, a Reagan appointee, called the new regulations so arbitrary and capricious the FCC should lose its deference from judges. The Supreme Court should now take the case on appeal to rule what \u201cdeference\u201d is owed when an agency sacrifices its independence and rejects its experts. In 2014 President Obama demanded that the FCC regulate the internet as a utility, under laws written for railroads and the early telephone monopoly. A congressional investigation concluded the White House \u201cbowled over\u201d FCC objections. The commission\u2019s Democratic majority ignored decades of agency analysis to adopt Obamanet, granting bureaucrats broad discretion to set rates, regulate prices, ban offerings, second-guess business models, and prohibit any innovation that violates a vague new \u201cGeneral Conduct\u201d standard. Congress never intended such regulation. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 declared the internet will be \u201cunfettered by federal or state regulation,\u201d except to \u201cpromote competition.\u201d The FCC \u201cspecifically forswears any findings of a lack of competition\u201d on the internet, Judge Williams noted. The chief economist at the agency later called the regulations \u201can economics-free zone.\u201d Judge Williams noted the FCC\u2019s \u201cutter disregard\u201d for the expert analyses: \u201cThe silent treatment given to three of its former chief economists seems an apt sign of the commission\u2019s thinking as it pursued its forced march through economic rationality.\u201d Judge Williams\u2019s dissent is rich in telecommunications law and economics. He warns Silicon Valley about the style of micromanagement it can expect under a utility-regulation regime. He cited a late-night call in the 1970s to the head of the now-defunct Civil Aeronautics Board from an airline asking about its application to transport sheep from Virginia to England, which was urgent because the ewes were in heat. Obamanet will entrench established companies and suppress startups. Regulations are \u201cmore burdensome for small firms than large,\u201d Judge Williams observed. Established companies are \u201caccustomed to having their lawyers suit up, research all the angles, participate in proceedings after notice has been given to all potentially adversely affected parties, and receive, after an indefinite stretch, a green light or a red one.\u201d The regulations arbitrarily bless some internet \u201cfast lanes\u201d while banning others. Telecom entrepreneur Daniel Berninger explained in a court filing that he can offer a new high-quality telephone service only if he\u2019s allowed to pay network operators for sufficient bandwidth to prevent \u201clatency, jitter and packet loss.\u201d Such \u201cpaid prioritization\u201d is arbitrarily banned under the new regulations. \u201cBerninger appears to be exactly the sort of small, innovative edge provider that the commission claims its order is designed to assist,\u201d Judge Williams wrote. \u201cIn the words of Shel Silverstein \u2019s children\u2019s song, \u2018Some kind of help is the kind of help we all can do without.\u2019 \u201d Netflix was the loudest lobbyist for Obamanet, but its crony capitalism will backfire if a future FCC invalidates its huge contracts with content-delivery networks that speed delivery of its video. \u201cIf caching is a form of preferential treatment\u2014and I cannot see why it is not\u2014then paid access to broadband providers\u2019 caching facilities violates the paid prioritization ban,\u201d Judge Williams observed. Overregulation will also discourage broadband investment. Economist Hal Singer calculates capital investment by the top dozen internet service providers fell in 2015 as Obamanet was being adopted\u2014the first decline since 2004. Judge Williams warned the new regulation \u201cshunts broadband service onto the legal track suited to natural monopolies,\u201d which \u201cprovides little economic space for new firms seeking market entry or relatively small firms seeking expansion through innovations in business models or in technology.\u201d The regulations will result in \u201cthe prevalence of incurable monopoly.\u201d In a better-functioning Washington, Congress would immediately reconfirm its 1996 legislation to restore the internet as a haven for permissionless innovation. The Supreme Court is the likelier salvation. The justices should refuse to defer to a regulatory agency that is neither independent nor expert.

Across the country, 14 states give letter grades to schools, according to the Foundation for Excellence in Education, a group founded by Jeb Bush. Advocates of the practice argue that letter grades \u2014 a glaring F, for instance \u2014 help nudge schools toward better performance in a way that vague pronouncements of proficiency do not. They also say the ratings help identify schools that are making gains with struggling students, so their strategies can be shared. Some states and cities have experimented with alternatives to letter grades, including star ratings and Roman numerals. Michigan uses a color-coded system, rating schools as green, lime, yellow, orange or red. New York State issues report cards to schools that include information on test scores and demographics, but do not offer overall judgments, aside from noting compliance with federal standards. Mr. Bloomberg took the idea of grading schools to a new level, inviting data experts to design a model that did not penalize schools with high populations of disadvantaged students, in the hope that they could be judged more fairly against affluent schools. The result was one of the most complex grading systems in the country, which compared schools serving similar student populations and focused on how much progress students made each year on exams \u2014 not just their overall performance. Almost from the outset, Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s report cards came under attack. Teachers faulted the mayor for emphasizing grades in deciding which schools to close, and for maligning struggling schools. Parents denounced his emphasis on test scores. (In the report cards released on Wednesday, which covered the 2012-13 school year, test scores made up 85 percent of grades for elementary and middle schools; the remaining portion was based on surveys of students, parents and teachers, and attendance rates.) Mr. Bloomberg was undeterred. The city brought letter grades to restaurants, based on sanitation inspections. Some city officials even began using the A-through-F system to informally rate their subordinates. But the report card system encountered hiccups, including in 2009, when 97 percent of schools were awarded A\u2019s and B\u2019s. The city responded by refining its formula each year, but the criticism did not abate. \u201cBloomberg and his team tried to build a system that was as robust as they were able to design, but in schools, unlike in financial markets, there is a lot of sentiment,\u201d said Frederick M. Hess, an education scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, adding, \u201cNo matter how sophisticated or smart the systems are, they\u2019re ultimately vulnerable to those concerns.\u201d In the early years, Mr. Bloomberg, flanked by top education officials, made a point of trumpeting letter grades at news conferences, warning of harsh consequences for failing schools. But the public rollout became more low-key in recent years. This time, the mayor was not present when grades were released to the news media; nor was the schools chancellor, Dennis M. Walcott. In presenting the results, Shael Polakow-Suransky, the department\u2019s second-in-command, said the city had made progress in trying to make the report cards more nuanced during Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s tenure. He said the city had begun experimenting in using alternative measures, such as class projects and student grades, instead of standardized exams. In addition, the city has turned its focus to how well schools prepare students for college. This year, the city judged high schools on whether their graduates were still enrolled in college after three semesters \u2014 a point at which many students drop out, education officials said. The latest report cards incorporated student scores on reading and math exams aligned with more rigorous standards known as the Common Core, which were introduced in grades three through eight in the spring. Many schools reported dismal results on the tests, prompting the city to adjust its grading formula for schools to account for the difficulty of the exams. The Education Department said it would not begin phasing out schools based on the results from the report cards this year. Mr. de Blasio has said he would move away from Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s practice of closing schools. The reaction to Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s final report cards was mixed. Some educators welcomed what they saw as the end of an era, while others said they thought it was important that the city not lose its focus on measuring results. Elizabeth Phillips, principal of Public School 321, an elementary school in Park Slope, Brooklyn, said the school had always earned a grade of A or B. But she said the grades were \u201ccompletely meaningless.\u201d \u201cThey fluctuate dramatically, from year to year, even when there are no significant changes in the instruction, or the leadership or the teaching staff,\u201d said Ms. Phillips, who has led the school for 15 years. At Public School 3, an elementary school in the West Village, parents were optimistic about how Mr. de Blasio could change the grading system. The school received an A this year, after earning C\u2019s the two years prior. \u201cIt does not paint the entire picture of any school,\u201d Dana Abraham, a co-president of the school\u2019s PTA, said.

This year's ceremony, which was taped for broadcast Nov. 9 on PBS, had a homecoming feeling to it. Martin, who has been a frequent presenter of the award, was this time honored by previous winners Carl Reiner, Lily Tomlin and Lorne Michaels. Which meant that half of the eight Twain winners were in the house (the other four: Bob Newhart, Jonathan Winters, Whoopi Goldberg and Richard Pryor). In receiving the award, Martin called it \"the only significant American award for comedy -- except for money.\" He added: \"When I look at the list of people given this award it makes me satisfied. When I see the list of those who haven't been given the award it makes me even more satisfied.\" He then pulled a slip of paper from his pocket, to read his favorite Twain \"quote\": \"For God's sake, please don't name an award after me.\" Not that anyone is keeping track of such things, but Martin, 60, is by far the most versatile of the illustrious group of winners. He has, among many things, won an Emmy for comedy writing (\"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\"), won Grammys for two best-selling comedy records; done sketch and stand-up comedy; written two off-Broadway plays and best-selling novellas (one of which, \"Shopgirl,\" has been made into the new movie starring Martin and Claire Danes); and assembled a world-class art collection. In the did-you-know category, Martin also won a Grammy for his banjo playing in the Earl Scruggs video of \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown.\" And so the evening inevitably skimmed the highlights. It was, in fact, like a Steve Martin career highlight reel, with the occasional roast as intermission. Martin Short, who has made four films with Martin, recounted that \"Steve got his first job in comedy as a writer on the 'Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour' because he was dating one of the dancers. Oh, by the way, Steve, Tommy Tune says hi.\" Short correctly noted that Martin took comedy from clubs to the arena (\"and back to the comedy clubs\"), becoming \"the first comedy rock star.\" Roll clip of Martin's 1978 stand-up performance at the Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles, with all the iconic bits: arrow through the head, the banjo, \"Happy Feet\" and, of course, \"Well, excuuuuse me.\" Lily Tomlin, who starred with Martin in \"All of Me,\" noted his somewhat overlooked gifts as a physical comedian. And indeed, one look at his work in that movie, in which Martin's body is inhabited by Tomlin's character, and his fancy footwork in \"Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid,\" was enough to prove the point. The biggest surprise of the evening may have been Diane Keaton, accompanied by a piano, singing a spare and lovely version of \"The Way You Look Tonight\" to Martin, beaming in the mezzanine. Diane Keaton, singing? And it was lovely? Yes and yes. Dave Barry, who wrote jokes for Martin's Oscar-hosting gig two years ago, mentioned that he performed his Academy Awards monologue with his fly open. \"And,\" said Barry, \" I think it says something about Steve as a performer, and as a man, that no one noticed.\" The most off-message message of the evening came from Larry David, who told a hilarious shaggy-dog tale in which Martin mistreats a homeless guy, plagiarizes a Dorothy Parker story, abuses a cat, acts boorish in a theater and finally insults David's Jewish heritage. \"Maybe next time you'll give this award to someone who deserves it,\" said David. \"Someone whose personal conduct is beyond reproach. Someone like... uh, you'll figure it out.\" Tom Hanks introduced \"The Great Flydini,\" Martin's brilliant silent bit from \"The Tonight Show\" in which all manner of things -- flowers, telephone, eggs, a martini -- emerged from Martin's fly. Martin has been so good at so much for so long, in fact, that the pre-show chatter from his comic peers and friends quickly ranneth over. Larry David called Martin \"quite smart and quite fastidious.\" Huh? \"Well, he has art in his apartment. It's stacked floor to ceiling. And he can name the artist for every single painting.\" Could David do that? \"If they were pictures of the Yankees of the past 50 years, I'd do just as well.\" Lorne Michaels recalled how Martin had guest-hosted on \"Saturday Night\" at the beginning of the show's second season, and then went on to host more than a dozen times, a record, with more appearances as a guest over the years. \"He helped make the show.\" Martin engaged in a bit of tomfoolery with old pal Martin Short on the Kennedy Center's red carpet. As Short worked the delighted crowd, Martin arrived to louder applause. \"It's my night!\" he yelled, waving Short off.

After all, Kenseth won a championship and 24 races, including two Daytona 500s, over his lengthy run at RFR -- one of NASCAR's premier organizations for the past two-and-a-half decades. The company co-owned by Jack Roush and Boston Red Sox owner John Henry was also the place where Kenseth began his Sprint Cup career in 2000, so there was a certain amount of loyalty involved. When the veteran driver surprised the NASCAR world by bolting for JGR, another top organization, it was only natural to question if his decision would prove beneficial. Las Vegas Motor Speedway, site of Race No. 3 on the schedule, provided the first real clue into what would be the ultimate answer. After running well but going 0-for-2 in his first two starts with his new team, Kenseth scored a convincing win at Las Vegas, a 1.5-mile track that bears a striking resemblance to several other mile-and-a-half venues on the series schedule. The Wisconsin native went on to record a career-high seven victories and finish a close second to Jimmie Johnson in the final championship standings. Robert Laberge-Getty Images North America Matt Kenseth is seeking win No. 1 of 2014. Now, as Kenseth prepares to return to Las Vegas for the running of Sunday's Kobalt 400, he and his No. 20 team are on the shortlist of favorites to wind up in Victory Lane. \"Vegas, before they reconfigured it, was probably one of our best tracks, and I was fortunate enough to get a few wins there,\" said Kenseth, who won twice at Vegas during his days with Roush Fenway, his most recent win prior to last year coming in 2004. \"It took me a little while to win there again, but it's a special place for me because I won my first Cup race with JGR there last year.\" Kenseth and his Jason Ratcliff-led team haven't reached Victory Lane in the first two races of 2014, but Vegas seems as likely a place as any for the duo to break through. In addition to being the defending race winner and owning a trio of triumphs at the popular facility, Kenseth boasts seven top-10s, including six top-fives, in 14 starts at LVMS. Kenseth, a notoriously poor qualifier, also has a pole in Sin City. Last year, he started 18th but led 42 of 267 laps en route to victory -- his first in three starts with Ratcliff calling the shots. \"It was just a really cool win since it was Jason's and my first win together,\" Kenseth said. \"It really was the start of a great season for us on the team last year, and so I'm looking forward to hopefully getting a shot at another great finish there this weekend.\" Ratcliff expects Kenseth's No. 20 car to be stronger at Vegas than it has been in the season's first two events -- the Daytona 500 and last weekend's race at Phoenix -- where he finished sixth and 12th, respectively, but failed to lead a single lap. The crew chief admits, however, that the team hasn't been quite up to speed so far on the new ride-height rule that took effect starting at Race Two. \"I'm anticipating that things are going to get exponentially better as we head to Las Vegas this weekend because I feel that we were able to learn so much last week at Phoenix in regards to the new rules package, as well as the new qualifying format,\" Ratcliff said, also refering to the new knockout qualifying format the debuted last weekend. \"Even though I just feel like we might not be performing up to our expectations that we had hoped for so far, we're learning a lot of stuff really quickly, and I think we'll be able to start applying some of that this week.\" And like his driver, Ratcliff carries a sentimental connection to Vegas, because it's the place where their stellar 2013 season really began to take shape. \"Vegas is really special for this group because it was our first win with Matt last season,\" Ratcliff said. \"I have a really good feeling about this weekend, regardless of the rule changes, and we have an afternoon of testing on Thursday, so that will help, as well.\"", "summary": "A victory last season at Las Vegas Motor Speedway helped fuel one of Matt Kenseth's best seasons in the Sprint Cup Series.

Wind (-1) and weekend (+1) cancel each other out. Today: Variably cloudy, breezy. Highs: 43-50. Tonight: Partly to mostly clear. Lows: 27-34. Tomorrow: Mostly sunny, breezy. Highs: 46-53. I think the best news about the forecast may be the lack of storminess, plus the odds of seeing a good deal of sunshine. Both are rare commodities around here of late. No doubt the clouds and precipitation will be back in earnest at some point, so enjoy it while we\u2019ve got it. A minor \u201cDecember thaw\u201d (though it really hasn\u2019t been too frozen) is at hand. Today (Saturday): Average highs are in the 40s across the area, 47 is normal for today at National Airport. That\u2019s about what we get on this one. Not too bad really, as long a you\u2019re dressed for that slow-to-budge offshore storm helping keep the winds up. I think we\u2019ll see periods of good sunshine, but with a fast flow aloft I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a cloudier period or two either. Highs are around 43 in the hills north and west to perhaps as high as the upper 40s in D.C., even around 50 if we\u2019re lucky or you happen to be further south. Northwest winds blow around 10 to 15 mph, with gusts past 20 mph. Confidence: High Tonight: Winds diminish a bit by evening as we lose the effect of meager daytime heating, which keeps the atmosphere well mixed while it\u2019s ongoing. Skies are partly to mostly clear. A good time to gaze up at the sky, as the Geminid meteor shower is at peak in the post-midnight to pre-dawn period. If you do head out late (or is it early?), plan on temperatures in the upper 20s and lower 30s across the area. Winds probably slacken to around 5 mph, plus a higher gust or two. Confidence: High For related traffic news, check out Dr. Gridlock. Keep reading for the forecast through the weekend\u2026 Tomorrow (Sunday): As CWG\u2019s Camden Walker likes to say, this day lives up to its name. Sunshine rules, and temperatures tick up a notch. Unfortunately I don\u2019t have news of the end of our run in with wind just yet, but we\u2019ll manage. Those blasts of air blow out of the north around 10 to 15 mph. Afternoon highs range from the mid-40s north and west, to the near 50 or low 50s range around the city and southeast. Confidence: Medium-High Tomorrow night: Plan on mostly clear and calm. A quiet end to a tranquil weather weekend. This once-chilled air mass is becoming a little stale, so lows are up compared to recent nights. It\u2019s still cool though, since it is December of course. The typically colder suburbs may settle to around freezing, while much of the area makes the low-to-mid 30s. Maybe 37 in D.C. Confidence: Medium-High It\u2019s sort of a shame we have to go back to work, because Monday might be the nicest day we\u2019ve seen in a while. High pressure passes overhead and that means loads of sun and little in the way of wind. It\u2019s not really a toasty air mass, but a bit above normal for the time of year. Highs should head toward the near 50 to mid-50s range. Get out the sunscreen! Or at least peel off a layer or two. Confidence: Medium-High High pressure doesn\u2019t choose to be a long-term guest and a low moving through the Great Lakes helps get an even milder flow going for a short time on Tuesday. Moisture is also on the increase, so temperatures may be slightly tempered by not maximizing any sun we can get this time of year. Even if clouds are numerous, highs heading into the low-and-mid 50s seem a good bet. Perhaps even higher. A risk of some light showers may increase during the afternoon or evening.

So much blood was drawn, Short said, that \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have any left.\u00e2\u0080\u009d D\u00dcSSELDORF, Germany \u2014 The medical treatment for Lindsey Berg\u2019s arthritic left knee has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and neither her professional volleyball team in Italy nor the United States Olympic team would help with the cost. But for Berg, a gold medal hopeful, the chance to dull the chronic pain was worth the money, and the risk. Dr. Wehling said he was careful not to use any substances banned by athletic governing bodies. So between the end of her professional season and the start of Olympic practices in California, Berg stopped at the office of Dr. Peter Wehling on the bank of the Rhine River. \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling with knee pain for the last four years and just continuing to play on it,\u201d said Berg, 31, who had tried surgery and cortisone injections to little avail. After examining her, Wehling and his team drew syringes of her blood. First they incubated it. Then they spun it in a centrifuge. The blood cells produce proteins that reduce inflammation and stimulate cellular growth; sometimes additional anti-inflammatory proteins are added to the solution. Finally, Wehling injected the orange serum into Berg\u2019s knee. The price came to 6,000 euros, or about $7,400, out of her own pocket, but with the Olympics in London coming up, any treatment that might make her knee better was worth it. \u201cIt\u2019s your body and your money because they\u2019re not paying for it,\u201d she said with cheerful resignation, on the fourth day of her treatment. Wehling\u2019s practice has become almost a pilgrimage site for athletes trying to prolong careers that have tested the limits of their bodies. It has also been the subject of no small amount of speculation after word leaked last year that the Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant had flown to D\u00fcsseldorf for the treatments. Alex Rodriguez of the Yankees traveled there as well. After the N.B.A. season ended, Lakers center Andrew Bynum, Bryant\u2019s teammate, said he, too, would try it. Commentators wanted to know if there was something fishy that required Bryant to go abroad for medical treatment. As his scoring average increased and the aging star seemed rejuvenated, the interest in the trips to Germany and the unusual treatment grew. To answer the most common questions: Wehling\u2019s practice is not at the end of a dark alley but in a modern building south of the city\u2019s old town; it is brightly rather than dimly lighted, with orange floors and a water cooler in the waiting room; and Wehling seems more like a true believer in his Regenokine therapy than a snake-oil salesman. He said he was careful not to use any substances banned by athletic governing bodies. Biologic medicine is a rapidly growing field. Wehling\u2019s Regenokine treatment might sound similar to another blood-spinning treatment, known as platelet-rich plasma, or P.R.P., that has gained popularity in the United States in recent years. In that procedure, the goal is to produce a high concentration of platelet cells, which are believed to speed the healing process. Wehling said his treatment differed from P.R.P. because he heats the blood before it is spun to increase the concentration of anti-inflammatory proteins, rather than the platelets, in his cell-free solution. The idea is not just to focus on mechanical problems in the joints or lower back but to treat inflammation as a cause of tissue damage as well as a symptom. \u201cThe potential of biology to treat orthopedic problems is high because it has only been developed a little,\u201d Wehling said in an interview. \u201cIt has to be embedded in a good concept more broadly,\u201d he added, emphasizing that sleep, diet and conditioning are among the important components to go with the injections. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as the one therapy that fixes everything.\u201d On a recent morning he treated not only Berg but also a basketball player, a golfer, a Hollywood executive and a former martial artist.", "summary": "Athletes like Kobe Bryant and Andrew Bynum, seeking to dull chronic pain, have increasingly found their way to a German orthopedist who tries to heal aging joints by manipulating patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 blood."}, {"text": "When Boston\u2019s Milan Lucic freight-trained Buffalo goalie Ryan Miller on Nov. 12, it set off an unusual chain of events. After the N.H.L.\u2019s chief disciplinarian, Brendan Shanahan, did not suspend Lucic, the league\u2019s general managers gave him new marching orders, saying that similar future incidents should be punishable by suspension. The N.H.L. will protect goalies the way the N.F.L. protects quarterbacks. Miller sustained a concussion. The Sabres\u2019 response to the incident was also viewed as weak. They neither started a fight nor avenged the hit by running over Boston\u2019s goalie, Tim Thomas. Not an especially physical team, the Sabres were branded as soft, lacking the necessary spine to stand up to the rugged champion Bruins, or any other team for that matter. As a result, they are burdened with the expectation that they must exact retribution when they host Boston on Wednesday. Using a memorable turn of phrase on Tuesday, Sabres Coach Lindy Ruff told WGR radio in Buffalo: \u201cThere are situations inside of a game that call for a lack of discipline, and this was one of them.\u201d The day before, Ruff met individually with players from noon until 5 p.m., mostly to discuss their failure to impose frontier justice on Lucic and the Bruins. \u201cIt was a hard day for all of us,\u201d Ruff said. \u201cIt was a hard conversation about what happened.\u201d Sabres players expressed a sense of shame at not retaliating. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed that we didn\u2019t respond the way we should have,\u201d center Paul Gaustad said. Tyler Myers, the 2009-10 rookie of the year, a 6-foot-8 defenseman who doesn\u2019t fight, was scratched from the Sabres\u2019 next game, in part because he did not respond to Lucic\u2019s hit. Asked if Myers should adopt a meaner stance, Ruff replied, \u201cI\u2019ll just use the words physical and more determined.\u201d Questions also arose about team chemistry. Were the Sabres unwilling to stand up for Miller? \u201cA lot\u2019s been said about it, and you know what? These guys have my back,\u201d an emotional Miller told The Buffalo News. As the issue simmered, broader questions arose about hockey\u2019s peculiar vigilante ethos. Throughout most of the sport\u2019s history, bad hits have brought fisticuffs. In recent seasons that practice has become muted to a degree. The on-ice officials used to allow fights to proceed, but they now step in more often to break them up. Skirmishes still break out after heavy hits, even legal ones when they are delivered to a star or a smaller player. But rules against instigating fights, as well as the heightened threat of suspension under the Shanahan administration, are increasingly preventing teams from turning their tough guys loose to exact revenge. On the night Lucic bowled over Miller, the Sabres\u2019 designated pest, Patrick Kaleta, had just returned from a four-game suspension for head-butting. His hands were tied by the risk of a much longer suspension for starting a vengeance fight with the Bruins. That night, the new Hockey Hall of Fame inductee Mark Howe, a highly respected defenseman who retired in 1995, told Canadian TV viewers he preferred the style of his era because \u201cthe players policed the game.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s so much onus placed on the officials right now,\u201d said Howe, who had low penalty totals and only four fights in his 22-year W.H.A. and N.H.L. career despite being the son of Gordie Howe, one of the roughest players in history. \u201cI don\u2019t mind the fighting in the game.\u201d \u201cThe game in the old days got rid of the pretenders,\u201d Howe added. \u201cAnd if someone was taking a shot at your best player, somebody got rid of that thing right away.\u201d Historically, notions that on-ice officials were overburdened with keeping the peace and that the league was ineffective in punishing transgressors were partly the sources of hockey\u2019s self-policing approach. But those elements of the game have changed in recent years. The presence of a second referee over the last decade has meant that fewer incidents go undetected on the ice. And with Shanahan\u2019s new department of player safety dedicated to discipline issues, the league has become more proactive in fining and suspending players for crossing the line. If the N.H.L. is indeed moving to diminish the role of fighting in the game gradually, a commitment to giving Shanahan firm direction to punish rule-breakers will go a long way toward changing the retaliatory habits of players. But Lucic, who has a reputation as a brutally efficient fighter, seemed surprised \u2014 even cocky \u2014 when the Sabres did nothing after he rammed Miller. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t accept anything like that,\u201d Lucic told reporters after the game. \u201cWe would have taken care of business. But we\u2019re a different team than they are.\u201d Those are fighting words.

She is all that, and as such, deserves a humongous, glittering crossover vehicle to introduce her charms to unknowing western audiences who, until they saw Rai, used to consider pointy-faced Gwyneth Paltrow attractive. Director Gurinder Chadha gives the stunning Rai her break with Bride and Prejudice, a globe-trotting, Bollywood-styled reworking of Jane Austen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Pride and Prejudice. If Chadha were a man, her casting motives might be construed as suspiciously pervy; she shows a distinct preference for babes over actresses, making a star out of Keira Knightley (and her lips) with the slight feminist soccer romp Bend It Like Beckham, and maybe doing the same for Rai, a paragon of human perfection bereft of nothing except talent. In other words, Chadha is a savvy filmmaker who knows that gazing upon beauty is a nice part of filmgoing, something Bollywood understands, too. Bride and Prejudice smacks of the director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ambition to cross-over and crowd-please; like the female leads she writes (Chadha co-authored the script with husband Paul Mayeda Berges), she wants to take on the world.

Lalita is appalled; apparently she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfamiliar with the buffoon trope of the Bollywood genre. If that surprises her, then no wonder she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s completely put off by Will Darcy (Martin Henderson), a wealthy American hotelier and obvious love interest. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alternately brash and awkward; she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consistently sanctimonious and superior. In fact, the queen of Bollywood is a haughty ruler who lives to chastise clueless Will with lines like: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought we got rid of imperialists like you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Even as she and her sisters don jammies and dance around like the girls of Grease \u2014 singing \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just want a man who gives some back / who talks to me and not my rack!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u2014 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m-actually-above-all-this in Rai/Lalita. She replaces Bennett\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pluck with Bakshi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rage, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s off-putting in a heroine. The word \"rack\" is about as raunchy as Bride gets; Chadha follows the chaste laws of Bollywood and has the lovers moon from afar. The barriers keeping them apart are threefold: personality (he has none; this angers her), culture (he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a developer oblivious to India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s charms; this angers her) and a blond backpacking British lawyer named Wickham (Darcy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s angry with him; Lalita\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intrigued). The men that Chadha casts are never as beautiful as the women; they look like somnambulant western catalogue models instead of exotic wonders. Subscribing to reverse sexism with the glee of a 14-year-old convert who just read her first Steinem, Chadha repeatedly shoots the men with their chests exposed from beneath billowing linen shirts. The love triangle jumps from India to London to Los Angeles, bursting into musical chaos along the way; a gospel choir appears on a California beach and singer Ashanti shows up in Goa fronting a choir of grinding Chippendales dancers. But for all its occasional exuberance, Bride and Prejudice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s post-colonial lecturing prevents the viewer from getting lost in the fun. No one likes an ideology lesson between dance steps. In the best Bollywood movies, narrative swings from farce to melodrama to boogying don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prevent emotional engagement, but propel it. These films might look like fluff to unfamiliar eyes, but achieving Bollywood style is tough, and Chadha isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as dynamic a director as her genre requires; wriggling crowds of dancers get cut off at screen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge, and sometimes Rai is shot flat and badly lit. Once in a while, Chadha manages to make her look \u2014 swear to God \u2014 a little plain. Chadha wants Bride and Prejudice to be a loveable hybrid, a merging of movies to mirror our present-day merging of cultures, a world that Austen could never have envisioned. But will western audiences lose themselves in the excitement, or engage with Bride and Prejudice as outsider rubber-neckers \u2014 the kind both Lalita and Chadha would loathe \u2014 straining to catch a fleeting glimpse of the exotic; something beautiful but no closer to being understood?

But he always dreamed of moving back west, counting on the government's promise to reward officers with apartments upon retirement. Now, as the Russian government pushes ahead with an overhaul of the military that eliminates the positions of more than half the army's officers, Primak is jobless at age 46 and stuck in Ussuriysk waiting for an apartment he may never get. \"They're finding any excuse not to keep their promises,\" the gray-haired colonel said coolly, maintaining ramrod posture as he sighed over a plastic cup of coffee in a roadside eatery. \"When we were young, we put the motherland first. We were ready to tolerate discomfort and wait for something better.... Of course I'm disappointed.\" Low morale over pay and housing has afflicted the Russian military since the fall of the Soviet Union, but grumbling in the ranks is rising sharply as President Dmitry Medvedev attempts to carry out the most ambitious restructuring of the nation's armed forces since World War II in the face of a severe economic downturn. The plan seeks to transform an impoverished, unwieldy conscript army built to fight a protracted war in Europe into a more nimble, battle-ready force that can respond quickly to regional conflicts. Key to the overhaul is a drastic reduction in the number of officers, who now account for nearly one in three Russian servicemen. By eliminating thousands of officer-only units that were designed to call up draftees in wartime, and moving to a leaner, brigade-based structure, Medvedev intends to cut Russia's officer corps from 355,000 to 150,000, dismissing more than 200 generals, 15,000 colonels and 70,000 majors. The plan has run into stiff resistance, with some top military officials resigning in protest and the Kremlin firing others. Retired generals and nationalist politicians have accused Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin of scaling back Russia's military ambitions by essentially giving up on trying to maintain an army capable of confronting NATO. Officers and troops have staged scattered demonstrations across the country against the reform plan, which would also shut dozens of military hospitals, schools and research institutes. A top complaint is the government's failure to provide apartments to all officers who are discharged after more than a decade of service -- a benefit that dates to the Soviet era and is written into Russian law. The apartments are important because military pay has lagged far behind the cost of living and few officers have enough savings to buy homes. But the army has suffered a severe housing shortage since the fall of the Soviet Union, when a wave of servicemen in need of lodging returned to Russia. The military's construction efforts have been plagued by corruption and inefficiency, and hundreds of thousands of active-duty officers as well as retirees are on waiting lists for accommodations. \"Our military organization, our fleet, has cheated me with housing,\" said Vyacheslav Zaytsev, a former submarine officer who was interviewed on television during a protest in the arctic city of Murmansk. \"A homeless officer is a shame for a nation,\" read one demonstrator's sign.

Spending also needs to be cut to balance the plan ( even the military ). Why not adopt Simpson/Bowles ? Ok, you want it? Here it is from the Washington Post: So here, with an assist from The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, are a few facts to keep in mind about the Simpson-Bowles plan. And while you're reading this list, remember: Simpson-Bowles is a centrist proposal. 1) Simpson-Bowles ends the the Bush tax cuts for income over $250,000. And note that they do that before they reform the tax code. The expiration of the tax cuts is built into their baseline. That way, their reform of the tax code starts from a revenue level that includes the revenue from those upper-income Bush tax cuts. 2) There are a lot of tax increases in Simpson-Bowles. $2.6 trillion over 10 years, to be exact. That's more than President Obama ever proposed. It's way more than the Republicans have ever proposed. It's $1.8 trillion more than in the \"Bowles plan\" that Boehner is proposing. Think about that: To follow the Simpson-Bowles recommendation on taxes, you'd have to take the $800 billion Boehner is proposing and then raise taxes by more than the $1.6 trillion Obama is asking for. 3) There are so many tax increases that the plan is nearly 1:1. According to CBPP's calculations, Simpson-Bowles includes $2.9 trillion in spending cuts and $2.6 trillion in tax increases. That's 1.1:1. If you add the $800 billion in projected interest savings to the spending side, then it's 1.4:1. 4) Simpson-Bowles taxes capital gains and dividends as normal income. The key difference between Simpson-Bowles-style tax reform and the tax reform plans we heard about through the election is that S-B eliminates the preferential rate on capital gains and dividend income. That amounts to a huge tax increase on the rich, and it's how S-B manages to lower rates while raising revenue and retaining progressivity. 5) Charities, homes, health care and states. Simpson-Bowles turns the deductions for charitable contribution and mortgage interest into 12 percent, non-refundable tax credits. It caps the tax exclusion for employer-provided health care and then phases it out entirely by 2038. It eliminates the exemption for state and local bonds. 6) Simpson-Bowles raises the gas tax by 15 cents. Just saying. 7) Congress has already passed 70 percent of the discretionary cuts. Under the Budget Control Act, discretionary spending will be $1.5 trillion lower from 2013 to 2022 than was projected in the Congressional Budget Office's 2010 baseliner. That means that 70 percent of S-B's cuts to discretionary spending are done. 8) Simpson-Bowles cuts security spending by $1.4 trillion, not including drawing down the wars. That's far deeper than what's in the law now, far deeper than anything the White House or the Republicans have proposed, and deeper, I believe, than the sequester cuts that so many think would devastate the military. 9) The Social Security changes. Simpson-Bowles makes three main changes to Social Security. It increases the taxable maximum on income to 90 percent of all income, which raises $238 billion over the next decade. It uses a different measure of inflation to slow cost-of-living adjustments. It raises the retirement age to 68 in 2050 and 69 in 2075. 10) Paul Ryan voted against Simpson-Bowles. And so, for the record, did Dave Camp and Jeb Hensarling, the other two House Republicans on the commission. Of the House Democrats, John Spratt voted for the proposal, and Xavier Becerra and Jan Schakowsky voted against. Among the senators, it was just the reverse: All three Republicans (Tom Coburn, Judd Gregg, and Mike Crapo) voted for it, as did two of the three Democrats (Dick Durbin and Kent Conrd). Max Baucus voted against it. 11) Simpson-Bowles went down in the House, 382-38. In March, Reps. Jim Cooper and Steve LaTourette brought a modified version of Simpson-Bowles to the floor. This incarnation of the proposal was actually quite a bit to the right of the original, including smaller tax increases and defense cuts. It failed, and failed big. These 11 facts should shed light on a couple of Washington's enduring mysteries. First, it should be fairly clear why the White House figured Simpson-Bowles was a nonstarter. They thought that if they endorsed it, Republicans would oppose it en masse, and hang every unpopular tax increase and spending cut around the White House's neck. In retrospect, I think the White House miscalculated here, but it's easy to see why they made the decision they did. The proposal the White House ultimately released included far fewer tax increases and security spending cuts than Simpson-Bowles. Second, as popular as Simpson-Bowles is among the CEO community, and on Wall Street, most of those folks don't know what's in it. Wall Street doesn't tend to be hugely supportive of taxing capital gains as normal income, for instance.", "summary": "House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, emerged Friday to say that \"no progress\" had been made on resolving the impending \"fiscal cliff.\" Capitol Hill's top Republican said that talks with President Barack Obama toward resolving the automatic tax hikes and spending cuts sched\u00a0\u2026"}, {"text": "Vitalia Diatchenko\u2019s hobbled performance Monday night against Serena Williams \u2014 which ended when she retired in the second set with a foot injury \u2014 stole some energy from the opening night of the United States Open and provoked more debate about how award money is handled for injured players. By the time Diatchenko began to serve in the second game of the match, it was clear that something was amiss. Unable to push off with her left leg, Diatchenko used only her upper body to serve, hitting halfheartedly and erratically. On return, she was little better, barely able to move for most balls. The crowd, eager to see a piece of history as Williams continued her attempt at a Grand Slam, quickly grew displeased with the uncompetitive match. Diatchenko retired after eight games, down by 0-6, 0-2. Of the 37 points played, she won five \u2014 four of them on unforced errors by Williams. After the match, Diatchenko arrived to her news conference with a support boot on her left foot and said that she had felt fine until sustaining an injury to her foot in prematch sprints, which she aggravated early in the match. If Diatchenko had withdrawn before the match, she would have forfeited the $39,500 that goes to players who lose in the first round of the Open. With payouts swelling at Grand Slam events, including those for lower-ranked players, many believe that a player is entitled to the minimum prize money simply by virtue of having earned a spot in the draw by her ranking. The $39,500 Diatchenko received for taking the court Monday will be a significant addition to her total earnings this year, which stood at $182,565. The issue of players\u2019 deserving prize money even when unable to compete has been raised more frequently as checks have grown larger, and it escalated at the 2014 Australian Open, when Polona Hercog retired after playing just six points with a pre-existing injury. John Isner, who played after Hercog that day and also retired, suggested a split between a withdrawing player and the lucky loser who takes his or her place. \u201cIn a situation like that, maybe a rule could be put into place so that the person who pulls out gets compensated,\u201d Isner said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, 75 percent of the first-round prize money, maybe 80, maybe even 100 percent of it. I think, at this point, a lucky loser is just happy to get in. I would be in favor of a rule change there. I don\u2019t know about that girl in front of me, but she earned her spot in the main draw.\u201d Serena Williams takes the next step in her Grand Slam journey later today, facing Kiki Bertens. On the men\u2019s side, top-seeded Novak Djokovic is the headliner on Arthur Ashe. When asked her thoughts on the predicament for injured players, Williams initially made it clear that she was not interested in pursuing the topic. \u201cI told you all in Cincinnati that I\u2019m not answering no questions that involve controversy,\u201d Williams said before settling into a more considered answer. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about that. I mean, you play to get compensated. You go to work to get compensated. I guess if you have a sick day in regular life, you still get compensated, so I don\u2019t know.\u201d Though hers was of the highest profile, Diatchenko was one of 12 players (two women, 10 men; seven on Monday, five on Tuesday) to retire during the first round of the tournament by Tuesday evening, a U.S. Open record during one round of the event. Some, like Diatchenko, were in obvious discomfort from the early stages of matches. Aleksandr Nedovyesov appeared immediately imperiled by a shoulder injury in his match against Lleyton Hewitt, losing the first set, 6-0, before retiring in the third set. Not all retirements were brought on by pre-existing conditions. Thanasi Kokkinakis retired Tuesday afternoon while struggling in the hot, humid conditions through the fourth and fifth set of his match against 12th-seeded Richard Gasquet. Aljaz Bedene was caught off guard when his first-round opponent, Ernests Gulbis, retired with an apparent right wrist injury in the middle of the third set. \u201cI was quite surprised,\u201d Bedene said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t say, \u2018Wait for the physio to come.\u2019 I was quite happy.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on September 2, 2015, on page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: Retirement Has Its Perks.

Other than both the 5-seeds beating the 4-seeds and the sixth-seeded Nets beating the third-seeded Raptors, all the top seeds eventually survived to the second round. It doesn't mean we won't remember the good times. Fittingly, the Spurs put an end to all the mayhem by finding their usual rhythm to quench the run of the No. 8 Mavericks with a 23-point blowout Sunday. Earlier, the Nets also put an end to the unexpected success of the Raptors, getting a late block by Paul Pierce to preserve a 104-103 win in Canada. Though most of the upsets were snuffed out, the second round is now setting up to be another great one with marquee matchups in each series. Takeaway: Maybe San Antonio just needed a taste of urgency. In their first Game 7 since losing last year\u2019s finals in Miami, the Spurs \"Oh yeah, we should probably win this,\" awakening. The defending West champions finally played like a No. 1 seed, getting back to their systematic efficiency while evading another standout performance by Monta Ellis or Vince Carter. It's hard to say if the Spurs overlooked the Mavericks or if the Mavericks just caught enough offensive fire to push it to seven games \u2014 or maybe we just have to recognize the Spurs' choice to pace themselves for a long postseason, preserving some energy. Regardless of the reason, the Spurs took the moment and painted it with black and silver. Star review: The Spurs' arsenal just has too many options. The beauty of the Spurs' offensive system is that it rewards its scorers with open shots from specific spots on the floor. For example, a post like Tim Duncan knows exactly from where he will get his shots and what option he is on any given play. The same goes for Danny Green, Tiago Splitter, Kawhi Leonard and on down that Spurs line. But guys like Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili have the ability to freelance, and when they get going and add to that systematic approach, the Spurs are just too tough. Parker turned into the lead playmaker for the Spurs, looking plenty healthy as he sliced to the basket and scored a game-high 32 points, including hitting 10 of 13 free throws, to go with four assists and four rebounds. Looking ahead: Game 1: Trail Blazers at Spurs, Tuesday, 9:30 p.m. ET What to look for: The Spurs' defense that showed for Game 7 will face a tougher test against the Blazers. Portland comes into the second-round series scorching offensively, but Spurs coach Gregg Popovich's schemes have a way of slowing down young scorers at the right time. The wing defense of Leonard and the veteran interior defense of Duncan will be tested, particularly by Portland stars Damian Lillard on the outside and LaMarcus Aldridge on the inside, but if the Spurs do manage the Blazers' offense they will win the series. Takeaway: Well, this wasn't what the Nets had in mind. Pierce was brought to Brooklyn to be the closer, but the expectation was that it would come on the offensive side. Instead, Pierce blocked the shot of Kyle Lowry on the final play of the game as the Nets survived Toronto on Sunday and moved on to the second round. Clutch plays can come on both sides of the ball, and the Nets will advance any way they can. The veteran advantage always seems to come into play in Game 7s and especially late in those games. While Pierce wasn't hitting his shot and was limited because of foul trouble, he still was the hero in the final highlight of the series. Moral victories are as empty as a Rob Ford promise of sobriety, so Toronto fans likely won't cherish only a first round of excitement. But it's funny how quickly expectations shifted from the target of an Andrew Wiggins draft pick to being just a game away from squaring off against the two-time defending champs in the second round. Toronto's season was a success, even if it may not feel that way after Sunday. Star review: When Joe Johnson is being double-teamed, that's good news for the Nets. His shooting was the pulse of the Nets' offense all series. Johnson, like Pierce, was originally brought to the Nets to be a dominant scoring threat. And yeah, about that veteran advantage... Johnson scored 13 of his 26 points in the final quarter of Game 7. Looking ahead: Game 1: Nets at Heat, Tuesday, 7 p.m. ET What to look for: This is the series Brooklyn circled last summer. The Nets were built to take down the defending champs, and of course Pierce and Kevin Garnett were the hired guns to help poison The King. The series will resemble the recent Celtics-Heat playoff matchups of years past. The pride of Garnett and Pierce is tough to extinguish, and of course the Nets' 4-0 record against the Heat in the regular season will provide plenty of confidence for Brooklyn.

Earlier this spring, SchoolBook asked parents to tell us about their school-related spending. Journalists followed up on the hundreds of responses we received, resulting in a series of reports on SchoolBook, in The New York Times and on WNYC. You can find previous reports here. Ellen Goldstein, the mother of first-grade twins at Public School 130 in Brooklyn, recalls with a twinge of nostalgia certain items that came home from school this year. There was the all-about-fish book, the Popsicle picture frames and two tissue-paper roses for Mother\u2019s Day \u2014 all made by her sons. What Ms. Goldstein, 46, will not miss plucking from her children\u2019s backpacks are the seemingly endless requests for money and supplies that also came home from their small school on the border of Kensington and Windsor Terrace. It began in September, Ms. Goldstein said, when she and her 6-year-olds lugged in $300 worth of construction paper, index cards, markers and crayons requested by their teachers. Soon, she was regularly receiving Scholastic booklets and permission slips for trips to bowling alleys and pizza parlors that required $5, $6 and $7 to be stuffed into envelopes. The school also organized two photo drives, including one in which she was sent key chains and bookmarks with images of her children on them. Unable to say no, she spent close to $90 \u2014 and that was in addition to the $90 for the first drive. All told, Ms. Goldstein expects to have spent around $700 by the time the school year ends on Wednesday. \u201cI am completely sympathetic to why they have to do this,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it really is surprising that we are being asked to give so much.\u201d New York City public school parents disagree on many things: the benefits of charter schools, the merits of gifted and talented programs, and what to do with failing schools. But as another academic year comes to a close, there is one thing many seem to agree on. As a result of several years of budget cuts, increasingly ambitious PTA\u2019s and shifting ideas about who should foot the bill for public education, having a child in public school now involves a staggering amount of wallet-opening, with every year seeming to bring more by way of financial demands. According to dozens of interviews and submissions from more than 400 public school parents to SchoolBook, the education blog of The New York Times, classroom supplies can cost $400. Fifth-grade graduation dues can be $95. Elementary-school yearbooks go for $30. At some Manhattan schools, it is no longer deemed excessive for a class parent to hand a teacher a $1,000 gift card as an end-of-year thank you, even though Education Department regulations prohibit teachers from accepting personal gifts. And the days of the free class trip are more or less over: a third-grade overnight to a nearby campsite can cost $120, and for internationally minded high school students wishing to join classmates and a teacher in far-flung locales, $3,500 is not unusual. Tina Manis, the mother of a sixth grader at New Voices School of Academic and Creative Arts in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, who spent $400 on school supplies this year, called the need for so much parental aid \u201ccriminal.\u201d \u201cThis is public school,\u201d she said of New Voices. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even have rulers or tape.\u201d An Education Department spokeswoman, Deidrea Miller, said that public school parents had paid for many of these items for years, and that assistance was available for those who could not. But parents said that in recent years, they had noticed an increase in the sheer number of demands and the dollar amounts expected of them. Jonathan Zimmerman, a professor of education and history at New York University, said that by demanding more financial support from parents, the city\u2019s PTAs, teachers and administrators were inadvertently altering long-held ideals about public education being free. \u201cI don\u2019t begrudge the people who are doing this,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what they now have is a kind of suggested tuition.\u201d To raise money, many schools no longer make do with just one photo drive, but host two or three during the school year.

Mr. Trafficante is the only survivor among three underworld figures described in earlier Congressional testimony as being enlisted by the Central Intelligence Agency in 1960 to kill the Cuban Premier. The two others were killed and their murders remain unsolved. Asked if he had been threatened concerning his appearance, Mr. Trafficante refused to reply, citing constitutional protection. \u201cI refuse to answer on my constitutional rights,\u201d the gray\u2010haired Tampa resident responded to 15 questions from the lawyer heading the House assassinations committee, which is investigating the deaths of President Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Finally, Representative Louis Stokes, Democrat of Ohio, chairman of the committee, reminded Mr. Trafficante that he was vulnerable to contempt\u2010of\u2010Congress citations for rc.fusing to respond. He then told him he could go but might be recalled later. Mr. Trafficante, Sam Giancana and John Rosselli had been mentioned in previous testimony as having been approached by the C.I.A. in the 1960' to develop plans to kill Mr. Castro. The cornmittee is trying to find out if there was any connection between the Castro plot and the Kennedy assassination. Mr. Giancana was shot in his suburban Chicago home in 1975 shortly after Senate investigators tried to question him about the plot. Mr. Rosselli was found dead in an oil drum in Biscayne Bay near Miami in 1975 after testifying before Senate committee. Questions asked by committee counsel, Richard A. Sprague, that Mr. Trafficante refused to answer included the following: \u00b6Had he ever been connected with the C.I.A. or any other Federal agency? \u00b6Did he know Mr. Rosselli or Mr. Giancana? \u00b6Did he know Robert Mayheu, a former agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a longtime associate of Howard R Hughes who once testified that he had been recruited by the C.I.A. to plot Mr. Castro's death? \u00b6Did he hve advance information that President Kennedy would be assassinated? Did he \u201cadvise other people of the assassination\u201d before it happened? \u00b6Did he know Jack L. Ruby, who killed Lee Harvey Oswald after Mr. Oswald was arrested for the Kennedy murder?

Many will flock to see him; seats at Yankee Stadium have already been sold out. However, the Pope is relatively new to the job and remains enigmatic and unpredictable on many issues. Most Americans and most around the globe still know little about this Pontiff. A skilled and experienced theologian, who was gatekeeper for Pope John Paul II on Catholic doctrine, he lacks his predecessor's skills in connecting with populations, in particular, with those who are not Catholics.\" Zealous conservative Catholics believe he has not been tough enough. Liberal Catholics fear a Pope who is concerned about the future of Catholicism imposing a theological conservatism that will further alienate or drive others out of the church. A recent Pew Forum report revealed that one-third of so-called \"cradle Catholics\" no longer identify themselves as Catholics. The Pope may be expected to reaffirm positions on abortion, stem cell research, and an overall \u00e2\u0080\u009cculture of life\u00e2\u0080\u009d against the culture of death. Conservative Catholics educators want him to deliver a strongly worded statement upholding orthodox Catholic teachings when he meets with leaders of Catholic universities and colleges. More liberal Catholics and educators, who are equally committed Catholics, fear such a statement would be a blunt instrument against a Catholic liberal arts education that includes freedom to engage, explore, and discuss controversial issues. Given the multi-religious and multi-ethnic nature of America, not only Catholics but also Jews, Protestants, Muslims, and members of other faiths and faith will be monitoring his comments on inter-religious relations. They generally perceive Benedict taking a more conservative approach to relations than John Paul II. To them, Benedict gives mixed messages. On the one hand the Pope reiterates positive Catholic teachings on inter-religious relations, delivered at warm personal meetings with religious leaders. On the other, he affirms conservative theological interpretations in statements and official documents that Protestants, Orthodox Christians, Jews, Muslims and others find offensive. The most prominent example of this vacillation involves Catholic-Muslim relations. Historically, the Vatican, especially through its Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, has been a pioneer in Catholic-Muslim relations. From Pope Paul VI to John Paul II, Catholics and Muslims have engaged in international dialogue and made common cause on issues of mutual concern at major international conferences in Cairo and China. However, Benedict\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more conservative retreat became clear in an international uproar after his Regensberg lecture whose primary topic, the relationship between faith and reason, was completely overshadowed by reactions to four paragraphs about Islam. Two incorrect assertions regarding the Prophet Muhammad and the Quran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship to violence and \u00e2\u0080\u009choly war\u00e2\u0080\u009d resulted in an international protest across the Muslim world. The Pope\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subsequent visit to Turkey helped to calm matters. Unfortunately, the Pope has continued to send mixed signals on relations with Islam. In March, the Vatican agreed to a meeting between the Pope and representatives of 138 Muslim religious leaders and scholars across the world who had issued an historic Open Letter, A Common Word Between Us and You. Some of them had already sent a respectful but substantive correction to Benedict a month after his Regensburg speech. The Open Letter, addressed to leaders of all the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s churches and to Christians everywhere, called for greater dialogue and cooperation based upon Islam and Christianity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common ground, the two great commandments - love of God and love of the neighbor. However, soon after at this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Easter Vigil mass at St. Peter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, the Pope\u00e2\u0080\u0099s baptized a controversial journalist with an Italian-Egyptian Muslim background, noted not only for his warnings about the threat of Muslim extremism but also for his unsubstantiated criticisms of Islam and Muslims. The Gallup World Poll, the largest and most comprehensive poll of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Muslims, representing the voices of one billion Muslims in 35 Muslim countries from Morocco to Indonesia, indicates widespread Muslim concern and resentment over what respondents see as the denigration of Islam and Muslims in the West. At the same time, these same Muslims indicate a desire for better relations based upon respect for Islam and Muslims. In a world in which majorities of Muslims globally feel under siege and in which Islamophobia is on the rise in America and Europe, many Muslims will be looking to see what Pope Benedict says in his meeting with inter-religious leaders. From a media and public relations point of view, any visit by a Pope can be dubbed historic. However, many will be listening to Benedict XVI to learn more about this new pope and the future direction of Catholicism affecting issues of doctrine and morality as well as inter-religious relations.

The blaze had burned about 40 square miles of very dry brush in the Angeles National Forest mountains and canyons, some of which hadn't burned since 1929. The fire was growing so fast, and the smoke was so thick, that it was difficult to map the size, U.S. Forest Service Incident Commander Norm Walker said. \"This is extremely old, dry fuel,\" Walker said at an afternoon news conference. The fire, which was 20 percent contained, appeared to be the fiercest of several burning in the West, including two in New Mexico, where thick smoke covered several communities and set a blanket of haze over Santa Fe on Saturday. Crews fighting the two uncontained wildfires focused Sunday on building protection lines around them amid anticipation that a forecast of storms could bring moisture to help reduce the intensity of the fires. The fire raging in Southern California had crews fighting the fire on four fronts, with the flames spreading quickest northward into unoccupied land, authorities said. But populated areas about 50 miles north of downtown LA remained in danger, with more than 2,800 people and 700 homes under evacuation orders in the communities of Lake Hughes and Lake Elizabeth, sheriff's Lt. David Coleman said. They wouldn't be allowed to return home until at least Monday and possibly Tuesday, Coleman said. About 2,100 firefighters aided by water-dropping aircraft, some of which were making the rare move of flying through the night, were attacking the blaze. \"We're putting everything that we have into this,\" Walker said. The cause of the fire was under investigation. Winds were blowing 20-25 miles per hour with gusts of more than 40 mph, so fast that speakers at the news conference were difficult to hear with hard winds hitting the microphone. \"That has created havoc,\" LA County Deputy Chief David Richardson said through the winds. \"It's had a huge impact on our operations.\" At least six homes burned to the ground overnight, and 15 more were scorched by flames, LA County fire Chief Daryl L. Osby said. Mark Wadsworth, 64, said he was confident his house in Lake Elizabeth survived. He spent Sunday parked in his truck atop a ridge, watching plumes of smoke rise from the canyons below. \"I've got nowhere to go, so I'm just waiting for them to open the roads again and let me back in,\" said Wadsworth. \"I didn't want to go to a shelter.\" The Red Cross opened evacuation centers in Palmdale and Lancaster. At Palmdale's Marie Kerr Park Recreation Center, more than 100 residents awaited word on when they could return home. Temperatures hovered in the high 90s, but were expected to dip, with humidity rising, later Sunday. Patty Robitaille, 61, grabbed personal photos and documents before fleeing her Lake Hughes home with her pit bull, Roxie, as flames approached late Saturday. She said her property was in the direct path of the fire. \"Driving away, you could see the town burning up,\" she told the Los Angeles Times. \"I don't think there's going to be much left.\" A huge plume of smoke could be seen from much of various parts of northern Los Angeles County, and air-quality officials warned against strenuous outdoor activity. The blaze broke out Thursday just north of Powerhouse No. 1, a hydroelectric plant near the Los Angeles Aqueduct, forcing about 200 evacuations in the mountain community of Green Valley. Several power lines were downed by the flames. The wilderness area is a draw for boaters, campers and hikers. Crews and residents were being warned to keep an eye out for rattlesnakes and bears that could be displaced by flames. Evacuations remained in effect for several campgrounds and two youth probation camps. Several roads were closed. In New Mexico, the forecast for moisture was not entirely good news. The potential thunderstorms also brought the possibility of lightning that could start new fires and gusty winds that could fan the blazes. The fire burning in New Mexico's Santa Fe National Forest 25 miles from Santa Fe had grown to more than 11 square miles by Sunday morning. Thick smoke from the fire covered Gallinas Canyon and Las Vegas, N.M. The fire near the communities of Pecos and Tres Lagunas had prompted the evacuations of about 140 homes, most of them summer residences. Crews also cleared out campgrounds and closed trailheads in the area as they worked to prevent the fire from moving toward the capital city's watershed and more populated areas.", "summary": "Fire crews in New Mexico fought two growing wild blazes Saturday that have driven people from their homes and scorched thousands of acres, while a shift in the wind prompted evacuation calls for more than 1,000 homes in California."}, {"text": "By Brendan Gallagher in Monaco Published: 9:35PM BST 04 Jul 2009 The powerful Swiss rider, the Olympic time-trial champion, risked everything on a thrilling final descent as he swooped down into the spectacular finish in Quai Albert to defeat Tour favourite Alberto Contador by 18 seconds with Britain\u2019s Bradley Wiggins claiming a superb third place a further second behind. After a slow start to the season due to fatigue and illness, Cancellara, 28, signalled his return last month when he won the mountainous Tour of Switzerland and will have licked his lips with relish when he saw the testing Monaco course. Contador likewise. Wiggins, having shed nearly a stone during the winter and worked hard on his climbing, had been cautiously optimistic of a decent finish though the vicious start \u2013 nearly 7km of steady incline \u2013 was not his idea of fun. In this city state, however, you have to play the hand you are dealt. Wiggins went about his task fearlessly and his reward could come later in the week. With Sunday\u2019s and Monday\u2019s stages likely to end in bunch finishes, he could find himself challenging for the yellow jersey itself in Montpellier on Tuesday when his powerful Garmin team are among the favourites to win the 39km team time-trial. Lance Armstrong, on his return to the Tour, finished a creditable 10th after taking a minor punt and opting for one of Astana\u2019s earlier start slots in the hope that the rain showers forecast might hamper the later starters. The rain failed to materialise but Armstrong produced a strong ride. In many ways nothing much had changed since he last rode the Tour in 2005. The seven-time winner was perpetual motion as he adopted his trademark aggressive low-gear, high- cadence style on the testing Beausoleil climb, which tops out at 630 feet and offers a superb view of the second smallest nation on earth. The descent to the finish was quick and technical but Armstrong maintained form in a ride which was lapped up by the Monegasque public and the 150,000 cycling fans here for the day. A degree of perspective was provided when first Tony Martin, the powerful young German who does such a great job leading out Mark Cavendish in the sprints, bettered Armstrong\u2019s time and then Astana colleague Levi Leipheimer went nine seconds quicker to take the early lead. \u201cIt was difficult for everybody, very technical and hard to find a rhythm, but that\u2019s logical after years away,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any illusions about winning but what a beautiful race. It was fun. I felt pretty good, overall. I\u2019m happy to be here, there are lots of other things I could be doing right now.\u201d As an examination of fitness and form such a demanding individual race is a pretty accurate Litmus test \u2013 between 1999 and 2005 Armstrong has only once finished out of the top three in 19 individual time-trials on the Tour. This told us that he is a phenomenally fit rider for 37 but perhaps just short of the peak of condition required to win. Armstrong will continue to improve though after a less than smooth preparation which has included breaking a collarbone in March and becoming a father for the fourth time last month. He now has a full week to sit in the peloton and hone his conditioning at race pace on the flat \u2013 interrupted by a full-speed workout in the team time-trial \u2013 before his Tour starts in earnest in the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es on Saturday. Of the other Britons, David Millar was his usual elegant self in finishing 14th but was denied the chance of a higher finish when his back wheel locked out twice approaching a sharp right-hander in the final stages, a mistake which cost him as he struggled to pick up the momentum.", "summary": "Fabien Cancellara might not have broken the bank at Monte Carlo but he will  leave Monaco the happiest of men on Sunday morning after going for broke and  destroying the field on the opening stage of the Tour de France."}, {"text": "In the decade since Israelis and Palestinians came close to a peace deal in 2000, the complexion of Jerusalem, perhaps the most sensitive of all the sticking points, has been altered. Israeli construction is blurring lines between Arab and Jewish neighborhoods, making any bid to share or divide the city even more difficult than in the past. A battle for sovereignty and international legitimacy is playing out on every hilltop and valley here. And with tens of thousands of new apartments planned for Jews in East Jerusalem -- well beyond the 1,600 announced in March during Vice President Biden's visit here -- the potential for construction derailing the new peace negotiations is high. \"Left unattended, within two or three years, enough will happen in Jerusalem that a two-state solution will not be possible,\" said Daniel Seidemann, an expert on Jerusalem who has provided informal guidance to U.S. mediators and who heads a nongovernmental organization that tracks how city planning affects peace prospects. President Bill Clinton, at a two-week peace summit a decade ago, pitched his own ideas on how to share Jerusalem, including control of sites that are holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims. He left office recommending that Jerusalem be an undivided capital of two states, Israel and Palestine. Now, following the recent flap with Israel over new housing in East Jerusalem, President Obama has started, perhaps inadvertently, with what Clinton found to be the toughest nut to crack. The Israeli approval in March of construction in Ramat Shlomo, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhood, while routine in Israel's view, drew international reproach, scuttled U.S. plans to announce peace talks and led to weeks of intensive negotiations between the United States and Israel on a formula to try to avert provocative actions. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu publicly declared that construction in Jerusalem would never be frozen. But he found a tactical way to appease U.S. officials: The regional planning committee that approves major housing projects in Jerusalem did not meet for two months after the Biden visit. It convened on Tuesday for the first time since, but nothing on the agenda involved construction of Jewish housing in East Jerusalem. Even with that temporary gesture, Israel continues with plans to house increasing numbers of Jews in East Jerusalem, in line with Israeli policy since the 1967 Middle East war to populate as much as possible the part of the city it captured and later annexed in a move not recognized by the international community. Today, more than 11,000 housing units intended for Jews in East Jerusalem have been given final approval. An additional 9,000 or so units -- including the 1,600 in Ramat Shlomo -- are in various stages of the approval process. Private and government developers are shaping plans for 30,000 more. For Israel, the issue of Jerusalem is about not just Jews' historical claims to the city but also demographic realities. Israelis fret about the Jewish majority of the city declining as the Arab birthrate outpaces that of Jews; by some estimates, the Arab population -- which today is about 300,000, or 35 percent of the city's total -- could equal the Jewish population by 2030. \"This is the Jewish capital of the world, and we have to maintain a solid Jewish majority in Jerusalem,\" said Yair Gabbay, a City Council member who sits on the district planning committee and is critical of international pressure to curb Israeli construction.", "summary": "JERUSALEM -- When the Obama administration launches indirect peace talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians, as early as this weekend, it faces a much more complicated landscape than the Clinton or Bush administrations did, especially in Jerusalem."}, {"text": "Standing before reporters, Clinton pronounced herself \"delighted\" to welcome \"a colleague and friend here to the State Department.\" Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu responded with his own diplomatic niceties, saying it was \"a great pleasure\" to be visiting \"my colleague and friend, Secretary Clinton.\" But thousands of State Department cables, just released by WikiLeaks, were providing a glimpse into what U.S. diplomats really thought of some of their counterparts - including Davutoglu. The correspondence, at one point, described Davutoglu as being among Turkish officials who are \"lost in neo-Ottoman Islamist fantasies\" and who \"pull conspiracy theories off the Web.\" For Clinton, the meeting became one more challenge in a massive damage-control operation she is leading on behalf of the Obama administration. That operation began weeks ago, as officials realized that WikiLeaks had obtained a huge amount of diplomatic correspondence. Since then, State Department bureaus have drawn up assessments of the expected fallout of a release. A task force was appointed to run a 24-hour-a-day \"war room\" at the State Department, starting last Friday. In the days before the disclosure, Clinton called leaders in Germany, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Britain, France, Afghanistan, Canada and China to warn them of the leaks, officials said. On Monday, in her first public comments on the cables, Clinton blasted WikiLeaks and expressed confidence that the release wouldn't permanently damage U.S. relations abroad. \"Let's be clear: This disclosure is not just an attack on America's foreign policy interests,\" Clinton told journalists in the Treaty Room, an ornate Wedgewood-blue salon near her office. \"It is an attack on the international community - the alliances and partnerships, the conversations and negotiations that safeguard global security and advance economic prosperity.\" Around the world, American diplomats had been contacting national leaders to soften the blow of the cables, some of which presented unflattering portraits of U.S. allies. Many American diplomats fear documents that WikiLeaks has not yet released could prove even more damaging than the cables that have been disclosed. \"Foreign Service officers are in shock,\" said one senior diplomat at an overseas embassy, speaking on the condition of anonymity to be candid. Clinton sought to bolster morale, sending a note Sunday night to State Department personnel - \"a message to the troops, if you will,\" said her spokesman, P.J. Crowley. \"We'll be making clear that, you know, we value the diplomatic work that is done at posts all over the world,\" Crowley said Monday. One senior official said Clinton was stoic about dealing with the damage. \"As the nation's diplomat-in-chief, this is really unpleasant, and difficult and uncomfortable,\" said the official, who was not authorized to comment on the record. \"But if you ask her, is it harder than trying to negotiate Middle East peace, or maintaining good relationships in Asia, or dealing with North Korea - no.\" Clinton told reporters that it was imperative that State Department personnel continue to write candid reports back to Washington - despite the current embarrassment. In a flash of humor amidst the gloom, she noted that one foreign leader shrugged off the blunt missives, telling her: \"You should see what we say about you.\"", "summary": "When Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton held a regular meeting Monday with her Turkish counterpart, there was little sign of the crisis atmosphere that has enveloped the State Department since the huge leak of confidential diplomatic cables."}, {"text": "Some singers have whiskey-soaked voices. Amy Winehouse has a whiskey-soaked oeuvre. \"They tried to make me go to rehab / I said, 'No, no, no,' \" the British soulstress sings at the outset of her marvelous new album, \"Back to Black.\" A punchy single with shimmering, '60s-style girl-group production flourishes, \"Rehab\" tells of Winehouse's refusal to heed a former manager's sobering advice. \"I always keep a bottle near,\" she belts. Booze is to Winehouse's music and public persona what sex is to R. Kelly's. Her drunken behavior has become the stuff of tabloid legend -- at least in England, where Winehouse has been a star since her 2003 debut, \"Frank.\" (The album was never released stateside.) No story about her is complete without noting that affinity for alcohol. Not since Dean Martin has liquor been such a career gold mine. Only in her case, it's Cuervo Gold. On \"Just Friends,\" a jaunty ska-soul song that boils over with sexual tension, Winehouse (her real name, by the way) observes: \"It's never safe for us / Not even in the evening, 'cause I've been drinking.\" On the bereft \"Wake Up Alone,\" she notes a minor victory: \"At least I'm not drinkin'.\" And then there's the video for \"Back to Black's\" remorseful new single, \"You Know I'm No Good,\" in which she clutches a shot glass as if it's a safety blanket. But Winehouse isn't just some bar singer with an easily packaged back story. She's one of the most exciting newish arrivals on the post-millennial R&B scene -- a 23-year-old artist with a knack for writing blunt, confessional relationship songs that are full of ache, attitude and humor. (Think Lily Allen with soul, or Corinne Bailey Rae with musical teeth.) On \"Me and Mr. Jones,\" Winehouse repeatedly uses a hilarious-sounding expletive to scold a no-good man. Among his transgressions? \"You made me miss the Slick Rick gig,\" she hisses, sounding downright indignant. And then there are those fierce, powerhouse vocals: so raw, so deeply emotional, so real -- sort of Mary J. Blige without the chronic pitch problems, although Winehouse's tone is more reminiscent of Billie Holiday's or Shirley Bassey's. Winehouse has an exceptional voice that's even more striking when you catch a glimpse of its source: a wispy, heavily tattooed young Jewish woman with a mile-high beehive for a hairdo and a Gothic level of mascara caked onto her face. It almost doesn't compute. While her look screams Hot Topic, Winehouse's music recalls two cultural factories from the past, Motown and Brill Building. \"Back to Black\" -- a No. 1 album in England, where it was released last year -- features knockout production work by Salaam Remi and Mark Ronson, who've concocted an alluring wall of sound that suggests Phil Spector working with the Funk Brothers in Hitsville's Studio A. (\"Tears Dry on Their Own\" even interpolates Ashford and Simpson's Motown classic \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough.\") It's sassy, swinging music that's heavy on echo effects, swelling orchestration, multilayered harmonies and brassy punctuation. But Remi and Ronson are hardly strict musical traditionalists, using a drum machine to add a splash of modernity to hits such as \"Rehab\" and \"You Know I'm No Good.\" Just as it's done back home, where Winehouse won the Brit Award for best British female solo artist, that classic-contemporary mix is starting to turn heads in America. As well it should: \"Back to Black\" is downright intoxicating. In fact, you might not hear a more thrilling or rewarding R&B album this year. So here's to you, Amy. Cheers!

Yeats admonished his colleagues: \"Irish poets, learn your trade.\" Seamus Heaney, born the following year, has learned his trade so well that it is now a second nature wonderfully responsive to his first. And the proof is in \"Field Work,\" a superb book, the most eloquent and far-reaching book he has written, a perennial poetry offered at a time when many of us have despaired of seeing such a thing. Heaney published his first book of poems, \"Death of a Naturalist,\" in 1966. It was a book of promise, and of promises made mostly to his father, family, race and country. A local book, in the sense that our household gods are local. The Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh encouraged Heaney to believe that Homer made the Iliad from a local quarrel, and that themes of parishes, villages and townlands may be turned into poetry by the right tune. So Heaney wrote of digging potatoes, cutting turf, eating blackberries, churning milk, plowing, a child's death, young love, water-divining, Catholics and Protestants in Belfast, but mostly of \"the sure green world.\" In his second book, \"Door Into the Dark\" (1969), the dark is a blacksmith's forge, to begin with, and then the other forms of darkness that shadow the security of earth, time and the seasons. One poem speaks of \"the smells of ordinariness.\" The art of poetry is likened to other arts, including thatching and smithery. In a few poems the young poet's veins bulge more than the occasion warrants, but mostly the rhetoric is true, well-earned. The poet in these two books is walking the land, training his eyes, getting the measure of things right. Landscapes are tactfully moralized, pressed to disclose values and meanings so gracefully reasonable that they hardly need pressure at all, only a few of Heaney's \"time-turned words.\" \"Bogland,\" the last poem in \"Door Into the Dark,\" made a new promise, that Heaney would go further, dig more deeply into Ireland's past. Bog is the only unfenced country in Ireland, a land without prairies, where the eye meets the horizon when it has scanned a few fields. In his next book, \"Wintering Out\" (1973), Heaney included some political and civic poems, mainly about the competence in pain you acquire by living in it -- he was still writing in the North of Ireland and pondering its \"little destiny\" -- but the most far-reaching poems reached down into the bog and magma of the country. His immediate source was P.V. Glob's \"The Bog People,\" an extraordinary account of the bodies that remained intact or a thousand years or more, protected by the bogland of Aarhus. In \"Wintering Out\" and his next book, \"North\" (1976), Heaney has several poems that give not the history of a sentiment but its archeology. It is my understanding that in \"North\" Heaney draws up on the long perspective of an ancient buried race to release himself from the appalling syntax of modern Irish history. Here are a few poems, such as \"Whatever You Say Say Nothing,\" in which there is no perspective and therefore no respite. The scene is Belfast, Heaney's town, where the only vantage points are held by soldiers. But the more typical, and indeed the richer poems, take the long view of the dead, going down through the dictions, fossils, quernstones, Norse, Viking -- evidence you read like braille. In \"Viking Dublin\" Heaney writes of \"a worm of thought I follow into the mud.\" And then: I am Hamlet the Dane, skull-handler, parablist, smeller of rot in the state, infused with its poisons, pinioned by ghosts and affections, murders and pieties, coming to consciousness by jumping in graves, dithering, blathering. In the deepest poems Heaney's feeling is \"lost, unhappy, at home.\" In 1970 Heaney went to California for a year, and also, I assume, for release from the violence of life in Belfast. He listened to new poetic voices: Robert Duncan and Gary Snyder, mainly. When he went back to Belfast it was assumed that he would become the spokesman, in poetry, for the Catholics, his own people. Instead, he left the North, gave up his job at Queen's University, went South to live with his wife and children in a cottage at Glanmore, County Wicklow. Some of his readers thought the move a capitulation, if not treachery, but Heaney had enough Northern wisdom to know that a poet pays a price for the thrill of being a spokesman. He heeded \"an early warning system telling me to get back inside my own head.\" He spent four years in rural Wicklow, years of retreat only in the religious or monastic sense, a quiet time for thinking and renewal. Certain themes were sequestered, so that Heaney might start out again from first principles and deep affiliations.", "summary": "Readers who want Heaney to go on writing political poems may be disappointed with \u0093Field Work.\u0094 They may tell him to leave the fields and return to the streets. The advice is redundant."}, {"text": "The multinational, multibillion\u2010dollar F\u201016 fighter program is plagued by production delays and cost increases, according to a report drafted for Congress by the General Accounting Office. The G.A.O. report said that the program \u201cis behind schedule,\u201d that its costs rose by $7.7 billion in 1976 and that its success or failure \u201cwill have a significant influence on the fate of future co\u2010production programs\u201d in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Air Force sources reported that the estimated total expenditure for the F\u201016 program for research and development through 1986 would be $13.8 billion. General Dynamics, the prime contractor, Pratt & Whitney, which manufactures the engines, and the Air Force dispute the G.A.O.'s criticisms of the program, contending that the program is proceeding according to schedule. The original program, which began in 1975, called for production of a new lightweight fighter to replace the F\u20104 by a consortium made up of the United States and four European members of NATO\u2014Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway. The initial target was 998 aircraft, of which the European members of the group would buy 348 and the Air Force 650. The Air Force has since announced its intention to buy an additional 678 F\u201016's. Additional sales are expected to Iran, which wants to purchase 300 F\u201016's, Israel, Spain and Turkey. Pentagon sources envisage a global market for the fighter worth approximately $15 billion. Since the memorandum of understanding was signed in 1975 by the five members of the consortium, the program has faced a number of problems. Some arose from engineering changes. Others resulted from the European members\u2019 requirement for an aircraft that will be more than an air\u2010to\u2010air fighter and will be able to carry out an air\u2010to\u2010ground support role it combat. The conclusion drawn by sources in the aircraft industry is that the solution of these problems will result in an increase in the $6,091,000 cost of each plane in 1975 dollars cited in the memorandum of understanding. The G.A.O. believes that the Air Force is concerned over the problem of restarting the engine at an acceptably low speed. The Air Force, however, does not think this is a serious problem and believes that it will be solved. Program costs\u2014originally estimated at $4 billion for the United States \u2014 increased by $7.7 billion last year with $6.3 billion of this resulting from the addition of 73 F\u201016B two\u2010seater aircraft to the program. The Air Force believes it can justify the addition of the other $1.4 billion. Planes to Be Built In Europe The co\u2010production sector has also raised some difficulties. The United States is committed to offsetting European procurement costs through European participation in production. Under the General Dynamics plan there will be two F\u201016 assembly lines in Europe, operated by the Dutch and the Belgians, each assembling 174 fighters. Fabrique National in Belgium will assemble Pratt & Whitney F100 engines for the European fighters. The G.A.O. report estimated that approximately 55 contracts would be awarded for European co\u2010production. In late 1976 only 23 contracts had been signed, largely because differences in European and American contractual and business practices had to be resolved. The report also said that the Air Force did not know the extent of the impact that European co\u2010production would have on overall costs. The Air Force replied that it did not believe that European participation would increase costs. General Dynamics, in an answer to some parts of the G.A.O. report, declared, \u201cThe F\u201016 fighter program is and has been proceeding on schedule and we do not anticipate any delays in the future. The F100 engine has performed in excellent fashion and we have experienced no (unintentional) engine stalls or engine restart problems.\u201d Assertions by Tactical Air Command officers are included in the report on the need for radar\u2010guided air\u2010to\u2010air missiles for the F\u201016 in addition to the infraredguided missiles that are now its basic armament. According to the G.A.O., the F\u201016 does not have space for the additional missiles suggested by the Tactical Air Command. Other changes in the F\u2010I6 have been necessitated to give it a dual capability; air\u2010to\u2010ground as well as air\u2010to\u2010air. These changes are due in part to urgings from the European allies. Potential for Further Cost Growth The G.A.O. reported the following other causes for potential cost growth for the United States: \u00b6European equipment produced to meet offset requirements is expected to be more costly than components made in America. An increase in European inflation could increase the cost of the American F\u201016's. \u00b6European production problems, especially in the quality control field, could result in delays and substitution of parts could lead to higher costs. \u00b6American commitments that fall short of European expectations, the G.A.O. said, \u201ccould become very sensitive\u201d and will affect dealings with NATO members interested in other co\u2010production arrangements. The last co\u2010production contract will probably be awarded by June, The Defense Department will then be able to revise the letter of offer and acceptance of January 1977 to \u201cstipulate more realistic prices based on known data and will know if the memorandum of understanding not\u2010to\u2010exceed price needs to be revised,\u201d the report said.

Ms. Moss and her colleagues hope that the novelty of the new setup and the experience of sitting so close to an orchestra will attract new audiences, the current mantra of classical music presenters. To that end the stage seats are the cheapest in the house: $38 tops, compared with $58 for the most expensive seats. To the practitioners and purists, of course, the most important issue is the effect on the sound. At a rehearsal this week, several of the musicians in the orchestra spoke enthusiastically of the acoustics, although some had reservations, at least with the current position of the canopy and no experience yet with an audience. Bodies in the seats make a large acoustical difference. \"This hall used to seem so impersonal,\" said Ron Oakland, a violinist. \"Now there's a general warmth in the sound.\" Michael Gillette, a member of the second-violin section, which sits to the conductor's right, said he was hearing himself better in the section but still had some trouble hearing the first violins across the stage. \"You actually feel more like you're doing something the audience can respond to,\" he said. \"That's the essence of live music.\" The festival's music director, Louis Langr\u00e9e, repeatedly jumped off the stage from the podium -- located roughly where the second row of seats would normally be -- and ran into the seating areas, listening with his arms akimbo. In an interview later, he said the new setup created more resonance and presence in the music. \"You don't have to fill the house with volume,\" he said. \"You can really just concentrate on energy without being anxious that it will be too anemic or too thin.\" The smaller stage seems more \"organic\" for a chamber orchestra, said Mr. Langr\u00e9e, a Frenchman who has often conducted on stages surrounded by seats in Europe. \"In two or three years, I will not be afraid to program, with this size orchestra, Beethoven's Seventh,\" he said. \"It's the energy that you need, the manic energy, not the volume, the loudness, the decibel.\" The stage, made of a South American hardwood literally called blood wood, extends out 30 feet. Eleven rows of seats were unbolted from the floor and are stored under the new stage, which is to be removed at the end of Mostly Mozart's season. Three new rows of seats line the sides of the stage, and another section rises in the back. Low walls with railings separate the stage seats from the players. Cylindrical silk light-shades have been hung over the stage to create a homier appearance. Audience members are close enough to read the music on the stands, or to tap Mr. Gillette on the shoulder. Sitting in the close rows of the stage seats will be a visceral experience and, depending on the location, cause some sections of the orchestra to be heard louder than others. A listener in the left side seats at Tuesday's rehearsal heard a French horn growl out low notes and saw a flute's silver glint. From the rear seats, a clarinet player was seen swabbing his instrument. On the right, foot soles vibrated with the thump of the timpani, and the fingers of woodwind players were seen fluttering through trills. The platform shook with each Langr\u00e9e leap. The transformation cost about $575,000, which mostly came out of Lincoln Center's capital budget, and reduced capacity by 365 seats, the festival said, to 2,363 from Avery Fisher's usual 2,728 places. Ms. Moss said revenue would be lost at some concerts because of the lower capacity, but the festival hopes to gain from larger audiences in the long run. The New York Philharmonic has said it would seriously consider moving the stage in future plans to refit the hall. Last year it tried out a simplified version of the stage extension during a rehearsal. \"It's a great next step from the experiment with the thrust stage a year ago, and hopefully what the future will hold,\" Eric Latzky, the Philharmonic's spokesman, said of the new installation. Stage seating is not unheard of in New York. Chairs are often put behind a soloist, and performers and audiences are occasionally reconfigured for specific concerts. The semipermanent nature of the Mostly Mozart arrangement (it will be used for 17 concerts) required complex logistics. Ushers had to be trained in how to seat people and box-office employees instructed on the new configuration. Space had to be left so pianos could be moved on and off. Staff members struggled with the problem of renumbering the seats. When they realized that the seat numbers were on metal plates, they had the idea of applying magnetized labels with new row numbers over them. Mostly Mozart officials proudly described the solution but several days later expressed fears that people would steal the labels if the information became public, and declared they would be taped down.", "summary": "Article on changes made to Avery Fisher Hall for Mostly Mozart Festival, which opens tonight; stage has been extended 30 feet into audience and seats have been added on sides and behind; it is only major stage in city to have such arrangement for orchestra concerts; photo (M)"}, {"text": "With his wife, Silda Wall Spitzer, at his side, Spitzer apologized for what he said were \"my private failings\" and said he is stepping down so as not to \"disrupt the people's work.\" He said the resignation will take effect Monday, to give his successor, Lt. Gov. David A. Paterson, time to make a smooth transition. Spitzer's resignation still leaves him in legal limbo, with prosecutors having given no public signals whether he might face prosecution. Three high-profile criminal defense lawyers who accompanied Spitzer to his Manhattan office, where he made his announcement, are trying to resolve his legal predicament with federal prosecutors. Though Spitzer's legal troubles appear likely to drag on, there was a palpable sense of relief in Albany, the capital, and across the state that the tawdry sex scandal of the previous 48 hours -- being played out in graphic detail in the pages of the local tabloid newspapers -- was becoming his private legal matter and that the state could return to its normal business. Legislators of both parties rushed to praise Paterson, 53, who will become New York's first African American governor and the first governor of any state who is legally blind. \"When one door closes, another door opens up,\" said state Assembly Minority Leader James Tedisco (R), who had threatened to lead impeachment proceedings against the governor had he tried to stay in his job. \"We've gotten this distraction over with, which had really gridlocked everything. We're excited about the potential of our new governor.\" Spitzer's fall was all the more stunning because he had been elected in November 2006 with 69 percent of the vote, the most ever in a New York gubernatorial race, and some Democrats even said he could possibly become the country's first Jewish president. But his life and career began unraveling last week, when federal agents, acting on wiretaps, busted a high-class New Jersey-based prostitution ring, called Emperors Club VIP, and arrested four people. The criminal complaint listed an anonymous \"Client 9,\" who was heard calling the escort service to arrange for a call girl named \"Kristen\" to meet him for a Feb. 13 tryst at Washington's Mayflower Hotel. The client allegedly paid for the woman's train fare from New York to Washington and $4,300 for a two-hour session. Law enforcement sources confirmed this week that Client 9 was Spitzer. Sources familiar with the case said Spitzer remains under investigation for possible violations of the Mann Act, which prohibits interstate travel \"for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery\" or for other \"immoral purposes.\" He could also face conspiracy and money-laundering charges, the sources said. A more streamlined case could involve charges that Spitzer structured his payments to the escort service in a way that was designed to evade bank-reporting requirements. Negotiations between Spitzer and prosecutors are probably complicated by many variables, including his desire to avoid losing his license to practice law, said New York University law professor Stephen Gillers. Under New York law, lawyers are automatically disbarred once they are convicted of a felony in state court.

Many of the deaths result from caregiver forgetfulness \u2014 often an infant left behind in the back seat by a responsible adult who was simply distracted. An article I wrote for Sunday\u2019s Automobiles section considered ways to prevent these heat-caused deaths, which can occur even when the weather is mild. Assembling data for the article was unpleasant from the beginning, but as the publication date drew close, reports of hyperthermia deaths began arriving at my desk at an alarming rate, making the task ever more stressful. On April 30, The Dallas Morning News reported that 7-month-old Brianna Jones had died after she was accidentally left in the back seat of a car parked in the driveway of a caregiver\u2019s home. Brianna was to have been taken to a day-care center by a family friend. When other errands distracted the caregiver, the infant was forgotten. Soon thereafter, she was dead. On May 27, The Associated Press reported that a 9-month old girl had died in Columbus, Ohio. A 70-year-old family member who had been taking care of the infant forgot that she was inside a vehicle. The outside temperature reached 87 degrees that day. By the time anyone noticed the child was missing, she had died. On the same day, The Fort Worth Star-Telegram said a missing 18-month-old boy had been found dead of hyperthermia in a neighbor\u2019s car. The circumstances that resulted in the child\u2019s being locked in the car are under investigation. On May 28, WOOD-TV, an NBC affiliate in Grand Rapids, Mich., reported that a 2-year-old girl in Wyoming, Mich., died after being left in a car, where she had fallen asleep. Janette Fennell, president and founder of KidsAndCars.org, counts seven hyperthermia fatalities in the United States so far this year, and in many states the weather is just starting to get warm. While we all recognize the wrenching tragedy of forgotten children dying in hot automobiles, most of us are certain it could never happen on our watch. That\u2019s a bad assumption. About five years ago my wife and I were settling into the role of empty nesters. Forgetting what we were doing became part of our new, less stressful routine. Where are we going? Oh, yeah, we\u2019re on our way to the grocery store. Then, overnight, we became full-time caregivers for our marvelous 11-month-old granddaughter, Grace. No problem. Having raised four children with reasonable success, we knew the transportation drill. Infant car seat, reversed in the back, secured as directed by the manufacturer. Soon thereafter, while out on a series of errands, I was daydreaming and completely forgot that Grace was sitting behind me. Luckily, my more aware spouse had accompanied me, so tragedy was averted. But my forgetfulness was a wakeup call that came through loud and clear. My daily routine had changed, and a return to the always-alert status of a full-time parent was required. While child-safety advocates, Congress and automakers wrestle with potential solutions to the forgotten-child hyperthermia problem, the rest of us can do our part by being mindful that anyone is capable of a tragic mistake. And while regulation may eventually require a forgotten-child warning device, focusing on awareness and preventive measures is the best immediate action that can be taken to help reduce fatalities. A number of organizations, including Kids and Cars, Safe Kids USA and the Auto Alliance have published recommendations for caregivers intended to help prevent hyperthermia deaths. The following list is a compilation from various sources: \u2022 When transporting an infant or toddler, place a cellphone, purse or briefcase \u2014 something you need for the rest of the day \u2014 next to the child. \u2022 Never leave a child alone in an automobile. Leaving a window partway open doesn\u2019t prevent the vehicle\u2019s interior from overheating. \u2022 Call 911 immediately if you see a child unattended in a vehicle. \u2022 Be extra-diligent if you change your routine for delivering a child to day care. \u2022 Tell your day care provider to call you if your child doesn\u2019t arrive on time. \u2022 When transporting children, check the vehicle\u2019s interior for any remaining passengers when you arrive at your final destination. \u2022 Set a reminder on your cellphone or PDA regarding day care dropoff or other child transportation needs. \u2022 If you spend your day at a computer, set a reminder that will query you about the whereabouts of your child before you start work. \u2022 Finally, if you\u2019re a parent or caregiver, remember that you\u2019re on active duty around the clock. Letting your guard down for even a moment could lead to a lifetime of deep remorse.", "summary": "There is no federal regulation requiring cars to warn drivers when a child is inadvertently left behind, but recent deaths suggest an urgent need for a device that provides such an alert."}, {"text": "The concerns, fueled by lingering suspicions and anxieties about the vast superiority of U.S. conventional forces, will do little to impede the signing of the treaty in Prague on Thursday. But they will render difficult further progress toward Obama's goal of a world without nuclear weapons. In a sign of the Kremlin's own unease about how the treaty will be received in Russia, neither Medvedev nor Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has uttered a word about it in public, even as Obama called a news conference to celebrate the conclusion of the talks and followed up this week by unveiling the findings of his administration's review of U.S. nuclear weapons policy. Criticism of the new treaty has focused on its failure to set any limits on U.S. plans to build a missile defense shield in Europe -- long a point of friction with Russia -- as well as a change in rules that will make it easier for the Pentagon to keep nuclear warheads in storage and quickly rebuild the U.S. arsenal if necessary. Others have delivered an even broader critique, questioning whether the entire post-Cold War enterprise of nuclear disarmament, including the now-expired 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, has served Russia's interests. \"The departing point or assumption of the critics is that the previous treaty was detrimental to Russian security, and the new treaty, which contains more concessions of Russia to the United States, will be still more detrimental,\" said Alexei Arbatov, an arms-control scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Center and former member of the Russian parliament. The treaty calls for both nations to cut their deployed arsenals to 1,550 nuclear warheads and 700 missile silos and bombers each, with an additional 100 such launchers permitted to be in repair or other noncombat status. On the ground, experts say, the treaty will ultimately require a U.S. reduction of about 100 launchers, the equivalent of two squadrons of Minuteman III missiles. Russia deploys fewer launchers than the ceiling set by the treaty. The limit on warheads should result in cuts by both nations. How deep the reductions will be is unclear, though, because of a new provision that counts bombers as carrying one warhead each regardless of how many are stored on their bases or they are capable of carrying. The overall deal may seem like a generous one for Russia, and given the Kremlin's tight grip on the political system, ratification of the treaty will no doubt prove easier in the Russian Duma than in the U.S. Senate, where its prospects remain uncertain. But Russian analysts note two substantial concessions by the Kremlin. Unlike the original START, they say, the new treaty won't count the maximum number of warheads each missile can carry, thus allowing Washington to make cuts by removing and storing warheads while keeping missiles in their silos. That means the United States could quickly rebuild its forces and dwarf the Russian arsenal, which relies on missiles that have less room for extra warheads. \"The good news is that your stockpile will be reduced, but the bad news is that you will have more warheads that could be redeployed in six to 12 months,\" said Sergei Rogov, director of the Institute for the U.S. and Canadian Studies. A more obvious retreat by Moscow relates to missile defense, which Putin publicly insisted as recently as December be included in the treaty. Although the Kremlin applauded Obama's decision to scrap President George W. Bush's version of the system, Russian officials have since voiced concerns about the regional shield Obama proposed instead, noting U.S. assertions that it would eventually use interceptors fast enough to strike a Russian intercontinental missile. Sergei Brezkun, a professor at the Russian Academy of Military Sciences, said missile defense and a reduced Russian nuclear arsenal would embolden the United States to take dangerous risks. \"When a person gets an advantage, he can go too far,\" Brezkun said. \"Unfortunately, further cuts would not only leave Russia more vulnerable, but strategic stability in the world will be more vulnerable.\" The Obama administration has said that it wants the next stage of negotiations to include tactical nuclear weapons, of which the United States has about 500 in its active arsenal and Russia about 2,000. But Russian officials say that such talks must be linked to NATO's superior conventional forces, as well as missile defense, and that the United States must first withdraw its nuclear weapons from Europe, where some allies want them to remain as a symbol of U.S. commitment to defending the continent. Pavel Podvig, an arms-control researcher at Stanford University, said a new round of talks trying to balance U.S. forces against Russian ones would only open \"a can of worms.\" If the new treaty fosters enough trust, though, the two nations might agree that tactical nuclear weapons have no military value and treat them as a safety issue, he said. \"You have to approach it as securing something that is dangerous and useless,\" Podvig said. Experts say further nuclear cuts would certainly face resistance from the Russian military. But Alexander Golts, an author and military analyst, said there is a growing consensus within the leadership that Russia's vast arsenal far exceeds its needs and is draining funds needed for conventional arms that might actually be used in a war. \"Military people who are professional know that, with or without this treaty, Russia has to reduce its arsenal,\" he said. \"All these conservatives talking about the treaty not being good for Russia, it's just militaristic rhetoric. It has nothing to do with reality.\"", "summary": "MOSCOW -- As President Obama prepares to sign a landmark arms-control treaty with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, a chorus of skeptics here is quietly expressing concerns that Moscow has conceded too much in the deal."}, {"text": "In a speech that served as her introduction to most of the nation after Sen.

Sandberg claims Lean In is \u201csort of\u201d a feminist manifesto. For me, it was simply a powerful woman\u2019s tale of getting to the top. My amoebic blob of a career, very much in its infancy, appreciated the nuggets of wisdom shared. Finishing the last page, I thought: This is a book every young woman needs. MORE: On Sheryl Sandberg and conquering confidence killers These past two weeks, I found out I was wrong. Very wrong. Lean In means something different to each of its readers. There are those who claim Sandberg\u2019s book distracts from feminism\u2019s larger goal of institutional change and instead focuses on the personal\u2013 and Lean In\u2018s followup campaign is all about Sandberg. (Maureen Dowd) A louder contingent believes Lean In excludes large groups of women lacking Sandberg\u2019s financial privilege. Who does she think she is, preaching from her 1% cloud of wealth? (Jodi Kantor) Sandberg spends the better part of her book presupposing these sorts of criticisms, apologizing that her words don\u2019t meet universal demands, but she still can\u2019t catch a break. Even Time magazine \u201ccelebrates\u201d the Silicon Valley executive with a far-from-positive headline on its cover: Don\u2019t Hate Her Because She\u2019s Successful. MORE: The pros and cons of job hopping The bashing is unsurprising, as it\u2019s become something of a trend to tear apart powerful corporate females in an attempt to promote the women\u2019s movement. (See guys, we are confusing!) Perhaps no book can be a \u201cfeminist manifesto\u201d today because there\u2019s no one-size-fits all definition of a feminist. My twentysomething friends and I are feminists, though we don\u2019t often define ourselves as such. Feminists aren\u2019t supposed to like The Bachelor. (We do.) They don\u2019t hang out with fratty boys who sometimes make politically incorrect jokes. (We do.) Feminists don\u2019t trash-talk other women. (Oh wait, nevermind.) To put it bluntly, we don\u2019t have the same hangups as older generations \u2014 what feminism means, what a feminist voice sounds like, and what a female role model looks like. (And that, of course, is because of the many battles those women fought and won.) We just want to be successful at whatever we do. Period. I gladly accept Sandberg as my generation\u2019s motivational cheerleader; I respect her. But instead of seeing her as the prescription, I see her as an inspiration. Ironically, her critics lean on her to be their all-purpose feminist solution \u2014 and the anger directed toward her for not solving women\u2019s social, economic, and workplace problems in less than 200 pages polarizes an already confused movement. When asked about returning to politics in Time\u2018s most recent issue, Sandberg says there\u2019s interest but now is \u201cnot the right time for my family.\u201d The Lean In platform certainly doesn\u2019t harm any aspirations she may (secretly) have. She\u2019s young, powerful, wealthy, and passionate \u2014 qualities that allow her to eventually create institutional change where it really matters: Capitol Hill. Too bad for her that she\u2019s not seen as the political voice every woman needs.", "summary": "Sheryl Sandberg's new book, Lean In, may be good, but it's the backlash that has people talking.

Gabrielle Giffords on Wednesday left intensive care for the first time since she was shot in the head in Arizona more than two weeks ago, the latest big step in the long road to recovery. With her progress moving at \"lightning speed,\" doctors had the Arizona lawmaker moved to TIRR Memorial Hermann hospital, where she immediately began therapy that could last several months. Doctors said she will have a valve inserted into her breathing tube to help her talk. When asked if the congresswoman was able to speak, neurosurgeon Dr. Dong Kim said, \"we can say that her speech function, along with everything else, is improving\" but declined to elaborate. Giffords, 40, had been in intensive care since her arrival Friday from Tucson, where she was shot Jan. 8 while meeting with constituents. The gunman killed six people and injured 13 others in a rampage outside a supermarket. Jared Loughner, the 22-year-old man accused in the shootings, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of trying to assassinate Giffords and two of her aides. He also faces other federal murder charges. Doctors had said Giffords would remain in the ICU until they were able to remove a tube that had been placed in her head to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid. A backup of the fluid can cause pressure and swelling within the brain. Kim said the catheter was removed Monday after a scan showed there was no longer a dangerous buildup of fluid. The three-term Democratic lawmaker's ability to swallow safely could mean she won't need a tube feeding her much longer, said Dr. Imoigele Aisiku, director of neurocritical care at Memorial Hermann. Giffords began physical, occupational and speech therapy just hours after she was transferred, under heavy guard, in an ambulance from the ICU of a Texas Medical Center hospital to the rehab center. \"It's a busy afternoon already and I anticipate it will be more so in the coming days,\" Dr. Gerard Francisco, the head of her rehabilitation team, said at a news conference. A breathing tube was placed in Giffords' neck after she was shot. Aisiku said while she can breathe independently and swallow safely, the tube cannot be immediately removed because of the length of time it has been in place. Instead, doctors will lessen her dependence on it, a process that has already begun, until it can be safely removed. Precise details on Giffords' recovery were scant out of respect for the family's wishes, doctors said, though Kim said Giffords was making progress at \"lightning speed.\" Doctors did not say whether she is able to sit up or stand on her own. Doctors had previously reported that Giffords was having difficulty moving the right side of her body. On Wednesday, they described that as \"weakness\" and said her ability to move had improved. The transport from the intensive care unit earlier in the day was done under heavy police presence. Helicopters buzzed overhead and police stopped traffic and blocked the road as an ambulance took Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, to the rehab facility. Television footage showed a gurney wheeled into the building. It was the first time she had been outside intensive care since the shooting, said James Campbell, a TIRR spokesman. Doctors said Giffords is doing her rehabilitation in her room and not in the hospital's large gym-like facilities where dozens of patients can undergo therapy simultaneously. Giffords is interacting with the staff and her family and is awake \"about as much as you or I are,\" Aisiku said. Also on Wednesday, The Washington Post reported that Loughner researched lethal injections, solitary confinement and political assassinations in the days before the attack. A source close to the investigation told the newspaper that a review of his computers turned up the Internet searches. Officials with the FBI and Justice Department declined to comment Wednesday on the Post's story. Loughner's alleged actions could help prosecutors as they begin the process of pursuing charges that could lead to the federal death penalty.", "summary": "U.S. Rep.

France and Germany will this week propose placing limits on the free movement of people within the so-called Schengen zone, an area that extends across 25 European states. Entry to one member state in principle permits free access to all the others. The French and German interior ministers are reported to be preparing to put forward a proposal on Thursday that would revise the 1985 Schengen Agreement to allow border controls to be re-imposed for limited periods to keep out illegal immigrants. Defenders of the \u201copen Europe\u201d ideal have accused them of bowing to right-wing populists with a proposal that could turn the clock back on what they see as a major benefit of a united Europe. Jean Asselborn, the foreign minister of Luxembourg, lambasted Nicolas Sarkozy for pandering to the anti-immigrant sentiments of the far right and said it was the president\u2019s own fault if one in five French voters chose the National Front in the first round of the French presidential election last Sunday. \u201cIf you repeat every day that we must change Schengen, that we have to have a tough immigration policy, that we have to talk about French exceptionalism, that is grist to the mill of the National Front,\u201d he said. Mr. Sarkozy appeared not to have taken Mr. Asselborn\u2019s warning on board when he told a rally on Monday, his first since the first round of voting, that the French did not want a Europe that was like a sieve. \u201cWe agree that we have to adapt to a new world, but we don\u2019t want to lose our way of life,\u201d he said. The French leader had already threatened during campaigning for the first round that he would pull France out of the Schengen agreement unless Europe provided better protection from illegal immigration. Germany\u2019s decision to support tighter controls was widely interpreted as a pre-election gift from the government of his ally, Chancellor Angela Merkel. The Schengen Agreement has already come under review because of waves of illegal immigration from Africa, in particular via Italy and Greece. The Italian and Greek authorities have been accused of allowing illegal immigrants to move on to other European states rather than tackling the problem themselves. Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German interior minister, told Germany\u2019s Rheinische Post: \u201cWhen countries like Greece fail to adequately control the exterior borders, then we have to be allowed to temporarily control the interior borders.\u201d Member states are already allowed to impose controls at national borders in exceptional circumstances. At the height of the 2011 Arab Spring, France closed its borders to trains carrying North African migrants from Italy. The European Commission ruled that the action was legal under the accord. Spain will seek to impose border controls with France for a week, starting Saturday, as Barcelona prepares to host a meeting of the European Central Bank. It does not want any troublesome demonstrators traveling to Spain to disrupt the party and is suspending the Schengen rules in the face of a potential \u201cserious threat to public order or domestic security.\u201d France and Germany want to allow such short-term suspensions of \u201clast resort\u201d to run for up to 30 days, a change clearly aimed at immigrants rather than protestors or soccer hooligans. The move faces resistance within Europe, not least because it might reverse the economic benefits of a border-free regime, and opponents have begun a campaign to fight it: @MartinSchulz @JeunesEuropeens and @JEF_de published a press release in which they condemn the plans about #Schengen jef.de/fileadmin/file\u2026 \u2014 Les Jeunes Europ\u00e9ens (@JeunesEuropeens) April 24, 2012 And Cecilia Malstrom, Europe\u2019s home affairs commissioner, responding to the expected French and German proposal, has reminded member states that any change in the rules must be taken at a Europe-wide level.", "summary": "The rise of the populist far right has prompted some European politicians to press for tighter border controls.

As the final notes of the anthem faded away, the musical tribute from the British armed forces, so warmly welcomed by those present, was greeted by a round of applause before a two-minute silence was observed. Traffic on The Mall, one of central London's busiest thoroughfares, came to a halt during the tribute. Standing rigidly to attention in the palace courtyard in front of the troops from the Coldstream Guards and the 1st Bn, the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment, the Duke of York, representing the Queen, took the formal salute. Beside him, with hand on his heart, stood William Farish, the American ambassador to Britain. The band then played a selection of sombre American music, including Hymn for the Fallen, written by the composer John Williams and used in the final credits of the film, Saving Private Ryan. Although it was a brief tribute to those who had died across the Atlantic, most of those present, many of whom had been prevented from returning home by the grounding of flights to North America, said that it had enabled them to \"come together to mourn\". Some Americans carried the Stars and Stripes flag while others held graphic colour newspaper photographs of the devastation in New York and Washington. Jenny Lee, 31, from San Francisco, saluted and waved a cardboard flag she had made herself as the anthem was played. \"I was really touched that the Queen has done this. Even though I'm so many miles from home, I feel that Britain is really with us on this one,\" she said. Susan Kramer, 54, who had been on holiday in Britain for two weeks and had lost friends in the New York attack, said: \"This shows that the world is sticking together.

Duchene hurt his medical collateral ligament when he ran into a teammate on the opening shift against San Jose over the weekend. He's expected to miss about four weeks. The loss is a big blow for the Avalanche, who have turned things around in coach Patrick Roy's first season in charge and are in the running for home-ice advantage with eight games remaining. \"We hope for a speedy recovery to be back as soon as he can,\" Ryan O'Reilly said after practice Monday. Duchene was trying to avoid a collision with teammate Jamie McGinn, but they awkwardly bumped anyway near the Sharks blue line. Duchene fell to the ice and then gingerly skated to the bench. \"One of those freak accidents in hockey,\" McGinn said. McGinn said he's called and texted Duchene, telling him to \"stay positive.\" Duchene posted on his Twitter account Monday that the \"thought of not playing in the first round for me has been devastating.\" He added that he will be \"doing everything in my power to be ready for Game 1... And if not then, shortly after!\" The 23-year-old Duchene has set career highs this season in points (70), assists (47) and shots (217). He missed three games earlier this season with an oblique injury. The team went 3-0 in his absence. For now, Roy said the plan is to move rookie Nathan MacKinnon to centre to fill in for Duchene, with O'Reilly and McGinn playing on the wings. \"We've been finding ways to win games,\" Roy said. \"We'll continue to find ways to win.\" Here's an encouraging sign: P.A. Parenteau, who sprained his knee on March 10, briefly skated on his own Monday. Roy said Parenteau could possibly be back for the regular season finale in Anaheim on April 13. \"We have depth and a lot of confidence in our players,\" Roy said. \"Our players have a lot of confidence in themselves. It's a team concept. It's how we've been winning our games. It's not going to change.\" Right after practice, Roy assembled his team at centre ice, just to give them one final pep talk before taking off for their game in Columbus on Tuesday. He told them he was \"proud of them\" and that the team shouldn't be satisfied, especially with Colorado trailing Central Division-leading St. Louis by only seven points. The message was well received. \"All year, guys have stepped up and done a great job,\" McGinn said. \"We just stay positive and work hard and good things will happen.\" Asked if there was any pressure stepping in for Duchene, MacKinnon responded, \"No.\" \"I'm not going to try to replace Dutchy, because you can't,\" said MacKinnon, a clear favourite for rookie of the year. \"Matt is a big-time player and we're going to have to find ways to win without him.\" Roy knows all about missing an integral player for the post-season. He and the Avalanche were without Peter Forsberg during their 2001 Stanley Cup run when Forsberg had to have his spleen removed after the first round. The team carried on without the Swedish star, beating the New Jersey Devils in Game 7 to win the title. \"That's the way it was in 2001 \u2014 it was about the team,\" Roy said. \"Peter was a very important player on that team, don't get me wrong. But our culture was we had to work hard every time we were on the ice. We had to find ways to win hockey games. \"That's what this team has been doing all year.

Although it is generally assumed that the introduction of self-driving vehicles is going to make the roads safer, there are still serious doubts about how we humans will adapt to being driven by a robot. \u201cIf you walked past the door you wouldn\u2019t realize there is a full-sized car inside here,\u201d says Dr Anuj K Pradhan, as he shows me into a nondescript office on a upper floor at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) in Ann Arbor, just outside Detroit. He is right. The room is much larger inside than expected, and in the centre of it sits a normal-looking family hatchback. It is the room that is exceptional, with huge screens wrapping around every wall, ready to drop me into a variety of driving environments on cue. This is going to be an immersive experience, however this simulator is not being used to simulate driving, but to simulate not driving. \u201cWe want to be able to simulate self-driving vehicles to understand human driver behaviour,\u201d Pradhan says. And then catches himself. \u201cExcept that they\u2019re not drivers now, they\u2019re non-drivers, or human operators.\u201d Even for researchers working in the field, the rapidly changing world of driverless cars and the terminology that comes with it can be a challenge. As we moved off I could feel a vibration and hear the engine noise \u2013 all recreated through bass speakers Until we reach a point where cars are self-driving 100% of the time, humans are going to have to resume control in extreme circumstances, when the computer encounters things it can't cope with. Those transitions between computer and human control will become critical. Sitting behind the wheel, I began to get a feel for the types of scenarios the researchers are studying. I put my foot on the brake, and slide the automatic gear selector into Drive. As we moved off I could feel a vibration and hear the engine noise \u2013 all recreated through bass speakers. Driving feels like a cross between reality and a game, and also, at this early stage, fun. I am aware that there are four cameras around the windscreen though, tracking my gaze, so that the researchers know exactly what I am looking at. I feel heavily scrutinised, but I centre myself in the lane, and then press the ON button on the steering wheel. A female computer voice states \u201cautomated mode engaged\u201d, and I relax a little. That moment, and my reaction is exactly what is being studied. At first, it was hard to take my eyes off the road. Decades of driving have taught me that is bad. \u201cHuman beings are not used to driving automated vehicles, so we really don\u2019t know how drivers are going to react when the driving is taken over by the car,\u201d says Pradhan. Will we relax, start texting, have a nap? Or sit with our hands hovering over the wheel, tense, and waiting to take control? The big promise of automated cars is that we can become distracted when we want to. The danger comes when the human is not concentrating on the road, and the vehicle suddenly wants them to take over. The driver, who has been looking at their phone, may not know where they are, what is around him, or what is happening. He will have to assess all that in seconds and take appropriate action. The irony is that that is only likely to happen in extreme events \u2013 in emergencies. \u201cDriving is a lot about situational awareness,\u201d says Pradhan. You can see what he means for yourself. The next time you are behind the wheel, spend a minute being conscious of all that you are aware of. For example, maybe the car you just went past had a teen driver at the wheel, so you had better keep an eye on them. And the car three ahead of you seems to be braking, so you better be ready to brake as well. There is a police station up ahead \u2013 so you become more aware of the speed you're driving. All of this situational awareness is a picture automatically built over time, not just a snapshot, and it is what you will be missing when a computer voice shouts \u201cautonomous mode disengaged\u201d and you look up to see the back of a truck that you are hurtling towards at high speed. Maybe you will be able to respond quickly enough, but maybe not. You are at a disadvantage. From BBC Future's experience in the simulator, and in other experimental autonomous vehicles such as Google\u2019s cars, it is pretty easy to become relatively relaxed. Technology has made great breakthroughs, but now I think the focus really has to be put on human behaviour - Anuj K Pradhan A particularly interesting question arises when we think about new drivers. People who get their licences in a few years' time are likely to only have to take control in rare situations, but those situations are going to be the most extreme and dangerous. \u201cShould we mandate that all drivers should gain five to seven years of driving experience before they can operate a self-driving vehicle?\u201d asks Pradhan. \u201cSelf-driving cars exist, so that is awesome,\u201d he continues. \u201cTechnology has made great breakthroughs, but now I think the focus really has to be put on human behaviour \u2013 the nut behind the wheel!\u201d The technology may be ready, but the big question is \u2013 are you?

The college student from Moldova was in the United States on a cultural exchange program run for half a century by the federal government, a program designed to build international understanding by providing foreign students with a dream summer of fun in America. So he summoned his best English for the e-mail he sent to the State Department in June. \u201cPleas hellp,\u201d wrote the student, Tudor Ureche. He told them about \u201cthe miserable situation in which I\u2019ve found myself cought\u201d since starting a job under the program in a plant packing Hershey\u2019s chocolates near the company\u2019s namesake town in Pennsylvania. Students like Mr. Ureche, who had paid as much as $6,000 to take part in the program, expected a chance to see the best of this country, to make American friends and sightsee, with a summer job to help finance it all. Instead, many students who were placed at the packing plant found themselves working grueling night shifts on speeding production lines, repeatedly lifting boxes weighing as much as 60 pounds and financially drained by low pay and unexpected extra costs for housing and transportation. Their complaints to the contractor running the program on behalf of the State Department were met with threats that they could be sent home. Events this summer at the Hershey packing plant in Palmyra, Pa., revealed major holes in the State Department\u2019s oversight of its summer work and travel program, the largest and most ambitious of its cultural exchanges. The program, which placed 130,000 foreign students in all sorts of jobs across the country this year, has a large impact in shaping the country\u2019s image for young generations overseas. The Hershey students finally got the department\u2019s attention on Aug. 17 when 200 of them, waving placards and chanting union slogans, walked out of the plant, the first labor protest in the 50-year history of the department\u2019s exchange programs. The protests raised questions about whether the State Department is equipped to manage what has become a vast temporary work program, especially in times when suitable jobs for foreign students \u2014 even short-term jobs \u2014 are harder to come by as high unemployment persists in the United States. The protests also exposed serious lapses by the Council for Educational Travel, USA, a nonprofit group based in California and one of more than 70 sponsors contracted by the State Department to organize the students\u2019 trips to the United States and find jobs and housing for them. The group, known as Cetusa, placed nearly 400 foreigners from 18 countries, many of them graduate students in medicine, engineering and economics, in physically arduous jobs at the Palmyra factory that were overwhelming for some. The students, who were earning about $8 an hour, said they were isolated within the plant, rarely finding moments to practice English or socialize with Americans. With little explanation or accounting, the sponsor took steep deductions from their paychecks for housing, transportation and insurance that left many of them too little money to afford the tourist wanderings they had eagerly anticipated. Program documents and interviews with 15 students show that Cetusa failed to heed many distress signals from students over many months, and responded to some with threats of expulsion from the program. Mr. Ureche, 22, an engineering student, said he had begun to appeal to Cetusa for a different job as soon as he went to work lifting boxes loaded with Hershey\u2019s candies. \u201cI\u2019ve been having serious back pains since the first day of work,\u201d Mr. Ureche reported in his e-mail to the State Department on June 6, sent two weeks after he started on the job. \u201cIf I continue in this rythm of work, it may cause me serious health damages.\u201d He felt \u201cmistreated and ignored by my sponsor,\u201d he wrote. And the organization told him, he said, that if he complained to Washington, \u201cthey will immediately cancel my visa.\" A few days later Mr. Ureche quit his job, making his way to New York and finding work. When the walkout came two months later, State Department officials reacted swiftly, opening an investigation centering on Cetusa that has not yet concluded.", "summary": "A group of exchange students sponsored by the State Department spent thousands of dollars to experience life in the United States, but what they got were arduous shifts in a factory and no help when they complained."}, {"text": "Roger Federer says he will not be at the French Open if the unspecified injury to his back does not improve sufficiently over the next 10 days for him to play with full freedom and, if he does start in Paris, he reckons his chances of doing well are \u201cnot great\u201d. So, we are a just little closer to knowing where the game\u2019s greatest player stands at 34 as he starts to creak around the edges. The finish line remains a blur but is not so distant as it was even a few months ago. We will know soon enough if Federer can keep his phenomenal 65-tournament run in slams going at Roland Garros, and he did his best in defeat in the third round of the Italian Open to blow the clouds away, if not with any great conviction. Related: Roger Federer a doubt for French Open after losing to Dominic Thiem in Rome Federer\u2019s high-end sponsors would be disappointed if he pulls out of the French Open, and his millions of disciples would be devastated. But the man himself will make a decision stripped of commercial obligations and sentiment. He cannot afford to make a fool of himself in public after 18 years of mostly controlled excellence. His health and what remains of his aura come first. Perhaps that is why a disturbing mix of hope, doubt and mutual impatience filled the room when he looked out on a sea of faces who most probably resembled pall bearers rather than hacks on deadline. He knew we wanted a story and he knew we knew what the best headline would be. He wasn\u2019t going to make it easy for us. There were the expected articulate and measured replies, the set-up shots before the occasional cross-table winner, as he explained away his 7-6, 6-4 loss to the rising young Austrian Dominic Thiem and set out how, despite nursing a back problem and seriously lacking match practice, he may yet be practising at Roland Garros next week. Federer, who came desperately close to pulling out of this Italian Open minutes before his match against Alexander Zverev in the second round on Wednesday, said he felt \u201cabout the same [as] yesterday, not worse\u201d. Losing to Thiem did not worry him, he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how I played. Important is that I didn\u2019t have any setbacks. I have only played five matches in the last four months, so clearly I don\u2019t want to get overly excited about what\u2019s ahead. \u201cI thought I could really do a good result in Paris. Now the last couple of weeks [after pulling out in Madrid and losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the quarter-finals in Monte Carlo], it\u2019s been more difficult. I see my chances as not great. But, if maybe in three, four days I can practice 100%... then I believe that something is possible again. \u201cClearly the way I\u2019m playing right now is never going to be enough for any good run in Paris; I also wouldn\u2019t play this way. I\u2019m still confident I will be fine somehow. \u201cThis was an information tournament for me. Never a result tournament. I knew I wasn\u2019t good enough for any result here, so that\u2019s why I hope you don\u2019t read into it so much \u2013 and I don\u2019t. I need to see this completely in isolation, and I cannot carry any luggage from here other than the positive information. It just needs to stay here, the results, what I couldn\u2019t do and how limited I was. I was far off. \u201cIf I can play 100% again and move again correctly, my mind\u2019s in a good place. My game is there. I\u2019m still almost beating Thiem, and beating Zverev with whatever I have. I\u2019m surprising myself.\u201d Now there are practical matters to attend to. \u201cDo we stay in Rome, do we go to Paris, do we go back to Switzerland? Those are three options there. Should I rest, should I train, what can I do with physiotherapy? I\u2019m so happy that I didn\u2019t get hurt again this week, that it was worth it that I played. I never had better clay-court preparation, to be honest. Conditions were perfect. I practised on centre court every day for about two hours a day.\u201d But the interrogation was becoming a chore: \u201cIn a way, I still enjoyed myself today, because I just said: \u2018Who cares what I do at 30-all? Who cares what happens, really?\u2019\u201d Then he grew impatient. \u201cYou\u2019re still, to some extent, disappointed, but OK, two minutes, and then get rid of the press, get rid of the doping test, and then I can\u2019t wait to have the meeting with the team and start relaxing and preparing for what\u2019s to come.\u201d Pressed about the nature of his back problem, Federer looked for the exit.

But from 1941 to 1946 a visit to North Platte was a moment 6 million U.S. servicemen and women looked forward to as they headed off to war, and one that they remembered more than 50 years after they returned. In North Platte, in the 10 minutes while the trains heading across the country changed crews, women--young and old--poured soldiers and sailors hot cups of fresh-brewed coffee and handed them home-baked pies and sandwiches and cakes, and sent them off again with a blessing and a hug. Eighteen years old, far from home, afraid of what awaited them and not knowing when--or if--they ever would return, the visitors to what became known as the North Platte Canteen found warmth and hospitality--and courage. A wounded soldier who passed through on a hospital train in 1945 later recalled in a letter published in the April 3, 1946, North Platte Telegraph: \"To think that you people, to whom we all were strangers, would do all you did for us. I can tell you there weren't many dry eyes in those cars when we left, and do you know why? Because you people, such a small part of our country, had really brought home back to us. You showed us that this was the real America; this was what we had fought and worked for and wanted to come back to.... \"We know you call us 'your boys' but I wonder if you realize whom we saw in you? We saw our mothers, our wives, our sisters and daughters and sweethearts--but above all this, we saw--America.\" It was 25-year-old drugstore clerk Rae Wilson who had the idea, inspired when she learned Nebraska's Company B would be passing through on Christmas Day. Rae's brother was in Company B; why not greet him and his fellow soldiers with food? She recruited half the town to help, and when the train pulled in, there they were, hundreds of women standing with baskets full of cookies and breads and sandwiches--but Rae's brother wasn't there. The Company B that arrived that morning was the company from Kansas, not Nebraska. \"What do we do with all this food?\" someone asked, and Rae said, \"Give it to the boys.\" And after the train had gone, she thought (or so the legend has it), \"why not do this for all the soldiers, wherever they're coming from?\" And so they did. And soon some 55,000 volunteers were coming from all over Lincoln County--women and girls and even young boys among them, bringing fresh-laid eggs, farm-grown beef and fresh-churned butter, and food that they'd prepared. It was the time of rations, but they brought their ration coupons, too. And every time the whistle blew--some 70 or more times a day--someone set another pot of coffee to the ready, and freshened up the table, and prepared for the troops coming in. Last month I visited North Platte. About 23,000 people live there now, a town largely of ranchers and farmers, the birthplace of Sen. Chuck Hagel and Glenn Miller's childhood home. At the historical museum, visitors can view one of the pots that brewed the coffee at the Canteen, and several of the cups, which soldiers took with them on the train and the conductor would return on his trip back. Most of the men and women who were part of that great story are gone, but three of them--retired Navy ETM Lloyd Synovec, Doris Kugler, and Lorene Huebner--sat with me on my visit and exchanged memories. \"You could hear the train whistle in the west,\" recalled Huebner, who, at 16, would wear her favorite \"flashy\" red dress to the Canteen, \"and you knew they were coming. Everyone would take care of something: You'd have coffee cups and magazines and cakes all laid out, just a beautiful spread; and the conductor would let the steps down on the cars, and it would get just mad. You could almost get run over if you didn't get out of the way, because they knew that there was food and that they would be welcomed there.

A draft report by China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has called for a total ban on foreign shipments of terbium, dysprosium, yttrium, thulium, and lutetium. Other metals such as neodymium, europium, cerium, and lanthanum will be restricted to a combined export quota of 35,000 tonnes a year, far below global needs. China mines over 95pc of the world\u2019s rare earth minerals, mostly in Inner Mongolia. The move to hoard reserves is the clearest sign to date that the global struggle for diminishing resources is shifting into a new phase. Countries may find it hard to obtain key materials at any price. Alistair Stephens, from Australia\u2019s rare metals group Arafura, said his contacts in China had been shown a copy of the draft -- `Rare Earths Industry Devlopment Plan 2009-2015\u2019. Any decision will be made by China\u2019s State Council. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about the China holding the world to ransom. They are saying we need these resources to develop our own economy and achieve energy efficiency, so go find your own supplies\u201d, he said. Mr Stephens said China had put global competitors out of business in the early 1990s by flooding the market, leading to the closure of the biggest US rare earth mine at Mountain Pass in California - now being revived by Molycorp Minerals. New technologies have since increased the value and strategic importance of these metals, but it will take years for fresh supply to come on stream from deposits in Australia, North America, and South Africa. The rare earth family are hard to find, and harder to extract. Mr Stephens said Arafura\u2019s project in Western Australia produces terbium, which sells for $800,000 a tonne. It is a key ingredient in low-energy light-bulbs. China needs all the terbium it produces as the country switches wholesale from tungsten bulbs to the latest low-wattage bulbs that cut power costs by 40pc. No replacement has been found for neodymium that enhances the power of magnets at high heat and is crucial for hard-disk drives, wind turbines, and the electric motors of hybrid cars. Each Toyota Prius uses 25 pounds of rare earth elements. Cerium and lanthanum are used in catalytic converters for diesel engines. Europium is used in lasers. Blackberries, iPods, mobile phones, plams TVs, navigation systems, and air defence missiles all use a sprinkling of rare earth metals. They are used to filter viruses and bacteria from water, and cleaning up Sarin gas and VX nerve agents. Arafura, Mountain Pass, and Lynas Corp in Australia, will be able to produce some 50,000 tonnes of rare earth metals by the mid-decade but that is not enough to meet surging world demand. New uses are emerging all the time, and some promise quantum leaps in efficiency. The Tokyo Institute of Technology has made a breakthrough in superconductivity using rare earth metals that lower the friction on power lines and could slash electricity leakage. The Japanese government has drawn up a \u201cStrategy for Ensuring Stable Supplies of Rare Metals\u201d. It calls for `stockpiling\u2019 and plans for \u201csecuring overseas resources\u2019.

The sculptor is sufficiently skilled in compositional finesse to imbue this deceptively simple process with an aura of mythological ritual.
