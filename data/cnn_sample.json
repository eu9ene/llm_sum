[{"text": "Johannesburg (CNN)He checked the series of stills on his camera. It was then that photographer James Oatway realized the entire attack had taken less than two minutes. It was the morning after a night of unrest in Johannesburg's Alexandra Township that saw foreign-owned shops looted and destroyed. Mozambican Emmanuel Sithole was walking down a street when four South Africans surrounded him. Sithole pleaded for mercy, but it was already too late. The attackers bludgeoned him with a wrench, stabbed him with knives, all in broad daylight. And Oatway had captured it all on his camera. \"They looked like hardened thugs, just by their intensity, the way they moved, the expressions on their faces,\" Oatway told CNN. \"They wanted one thing and that was to kill Emmanuel. They wanted his blood and nothing was going to stop them from doing that.\" Oatway says he tried to get as close as possible, conscious that the attackers were aware of his presence. \"When the attack started I was 20 meters (65 feet) away, but at one point I was 4 or 5 meters away,\" he said. \"I did think that maybe they would leave him alone.\" The attackers finally did move on and leave Sithole alone. Oatway and his fellow journalist Beauregard Tromp quickly put the injured man in the back of the car and rushed him to a hospital, where he later died. \"I still remember him looking straight into my eyes,\" said Oatway. \"He had a kind of a dazed, shocked look in his face.\" Oatway's series of images of the ordeal landed on the front page of South Africa's Sunday Times under the headline, \"Kill thy neighbor: Alex attack brings home SA's shame.\" It's a shame that South Africa continues to confront. Seven people have been killed in the latest round of xenophobic violence against poorer immigrants, many from South Africa's neighbors. Xenophobic attacks: How did we get here? Local media alleged that the attacks were a consequence of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini reportedly saying at a recent gathering that foreigners \"should pack their bags and go\" because they are taking jobs from citizens. Shortly after his reported comments, violence against immigrants erupted in the port city of Durban. But on Monday, Zwelithini said he had not called for a war on immigrants. \"This war I am calling for today is to protect everyone of foreign origin in this country irrespective of which country they are from.\" The United Nations said the attacks actually began in March after a labor dispute between citizens and foreign workers. OPINION: Labeling South Africa violence as xenophobia misses the point. But it was Oatway's photos of the violent attack on Sithole that have seemingly encapsulated the true horror of the situation -- and South Africa's leaders have begun to take notice. \"Terrible picture. People who live in rough townships have never seen such a scene,\" said President Jacob Zuma about the photos in a televised news conference. \"And I was sitting and I was saying to myself, what are we telling the world about ourselves?\" Police announced they've now arrested all four suspects -- the last caught overnight Tuesday -- with help from Oatway's photos, which is little solace for the photographer who captured a level of depravity rarely seen. \"I'm sickened by it,\" said Oatway. \"And I'm extremely angry, angry with the men that did this, and ultimately I'm upset that our efforts weren't successful in saving Emmanuel's life.\"", "summary": "Photographer James Oatway captured a violent attack that resulted in death of a Mozambican in South Africa.

The latest remarks echo criticisms voiced by clergy in the UK, who tore into the series for its 'perverse' depictions of the historical characters when it first aired. Scroll down for video.

The audience is encouraged to support 'monster' Thomas Cromwell, played by Mark Rylance in the hit series, a damning review by the Catholic News Service in America said after the first episode was aired in the USA. The review also slates the depiction of Catholic martyr Sir Thomas More, played by Anton Lesser in the show as an 'evidence-flouting caricature' that is 'sleazy, mean-spirited and just plain rude' A review for Catholic News Service, an agency of the U.S. Bishops\u2019 Conference said that the show encourages the audience to \u2018root for the self-made commoner Thomas Cromwell\u2019 when in fact he was a \u2018monster\u2019 who engineered a reign of terror and murdered anyone who stood in his way. In contrast, the drama\u2019s depiction of Sir Thomas More, a Catholic martyr, is \u2018not a pretty sight\u2019, said author Joseph McAleer. \u2018The future saint is barely recognisable: sleazy, mean-spirited and just plain rude,\u2019 he writes. \u2018This evidence-flouting caricature is light-years away from the man of principle.\u2019 A Washington Post reviewer warned the distortion of historical facts in Wolf Hall pointed to 'ideological bias' US media were generally looking forward to the historical drama being shows on Masterpiece PBS as a 'great British import', with Homeland star Damian Lewis as King Henry VIII and Claire Foy playing Anne Boleyn. Gregory Wolfe said that the adaptation of Hilary Mantel's book 'could obscure important lessons' The criticism from the U.S. Catholic Church follows that of Mark Davies and Mark O\u2019Toole, the Catholic Bishops of Shrewsbury and Plymouth, who said Wolf Hall was guilty of \u2018anti-Catholic\u2019 depictions of More, played by Anton Lesser, and for its whitewashing of Cromwell, the hero of the drama, played by Mark Rylance. Most U.S. media looked forward, however, to the opening episode of the series, broadcast on Masterpiece PBS last night, as a great British import co-starring Damien Lewis, the anti-hero Brody in the U.S. series Homeland, playing King Henry VIII. One of the few critical reviews of the adaptation of Hilary Mantel\u2019s historical novel appeared in the highly-influential Washington Post, however, which warned viewers that the distortion of the facts pointed to a \u2018clear ideological bias\u2019. \u2018What makes for great drama may not make for good history,\u2019 said the review by Gregory Wolfe. \u2018Mantel\u2019s version could obscure important lessons from that dark period that have continuing relevance for the present moment,\u2019 he added.

Craig Roberts, 36, from Chadderton, Manchester, walked into his town's Post Office and an employee shouted from behind the counter that he would have to leave his guide dog Bruce outside if he wanted to be served. Even when Mr Roberts explained his two-year-old Golden Labrador Retriever Cross was a guide dog, the employee allegedly still insisted he should be left outside. Scroll down for video. Humiliated: Craig Roberts, 36, was told by Post Office staff in Chadderton, Manchester, that he would have to leave his guide dog Bruce outside if he wanted to be served. He said he was left feeling 'angry and shocked' Mr Roberts said: 'I was left feeling so angry and shocked. It is unacceptable that I should be made to feel like I had done something wrong by going to the Post Office with my guide dog. In this day and age there should be more awareness than that.' He added: 'Luckily a couple of customers heard him and said he wasn't allowed to do it because I had a guide dog and that he would have to let me in. He was told a few times and wasn't happy about it.' Mr Roberts, who had gone to the Post Office to top up his electric meter with his payment card, was eventually served by the employee after a ten minute standoff. He said: 'He did serve me in the end. I think he only served me because the other customers interjected. You could tell they were angry and a couple shouted \"you can't do that, he has a guide dog\".' The Post Office in Chadderton, Manchester, where Mr Roberts was told he had to leave his guide dog outside. Mr Roberts was born with glaucoma, a condition which affects eyesight as a result of pressure built up behind the eye, but in the last 12 months has seen a radical decline in his sight. He now has only 30 per cent vision in one eye which means he can't work and struggles with everyday tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The 36-year-old, who lives alone, said: 'I find it difficult doing everyday tasks at home as it is. Making a meal is tricky as I have to make sure it is cooked and cleaning is quite hard because I can't see dust and dirt. Under the Equality Act 2010, people with disabilities have the same right to services supplied by shops, banks, hotels, libraries, pubs, taxis and restaurants as everyone else. Service providers also have to make 'reasonable adjustments' for guide dog and assistance dog owners which might mean offering extra help, and this includes allowing guide dogs and assistance dogs into all public places with their owners. 'It takes quite a lot to go out to the shops as it is and so to be made to feel that I can't even go to the Post Office to simply pay a bill is ridiculous.' Mr Roberts said he has 'never experienced anything like this before' but that he has been told a similar incident with a fellow guide dog user at this particular Post Office has happened. He added: 'This incident has really knocked my confidence and made me think if I can't take Bruce to the Post Office, will this happened again at the shops or a caf\u00e9? It was really embarrassing and humiliating.' So angered was Mr Roberts by the incident that he went straight to a nearby library and lodged an official complaint with the Post Office. He also contacted Manchester Guide Dogs Association, which has been in contact with the Post Office. Sorry: The Post Office has issued an apology 'for any distress caused' following the incident. A spokesman for Guide Dogs said: 'We're always saddened when we hear about a shop or another service provider refusing access to a guide dog owner. The Equality Act 2010 makes it illegal to deny access to a guide dog owner. We are always happy to work with the Post Office, or any other organisation to help them understand their duties under the Equalities Act.' Mr Roberts said: 'I want a written apology from the Post Office and assurance this will never happen to me or any other guide dog user again. 'It is totally unacceptable and they should have greater awareness.' Having posted the incident on Facebook he said he had received numerous comments in support of his complaint. 'One gentleman said that if that is the way the Post Office deals with a disabled person he would never come into the Post Office again,' said Mr Roberts, who has had Bruce for seven months and says he's his best friend. He has called the Chadderton Post Office employee's response to his guide dog 'outdated'. 'It is clearly an outdated view of things. I think something needs to be done to educate people that if you have a guide dog it should not stop you from getting about and shouldn't stop you from doing the things that everyone else gets to do,' Mr Roberts said. 'I was determined to get this into the public eye because it probably does happen too often and happening just once is too many times.' A spokesman for the Post Office said: 'Post Office policy is to allow guide dogs and other assistance dogs into branches and we would like to apologise for any distress caused.'

Some of the hundreds who confronted lines of police officers got into shoving matches with helmeted cops while other demonstrators threw objects. At least five police cars were damaged by people who smashed windows and jumped on them. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said she was profoundly disappointed by the violence, adding that 95% of the protesters were respectful but a \"small group of agitators intervened.\" Twelve people were arrested, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said. \"We continue to have a few isolated pockets of individuals causing disturbances. We are deploying resources to keep everyone safe,\" the Baltimore Police Department tweeted. Fredericka Gray, the twin sister of Freddie Gray, made a statement: \"My family wants to say, 'Can y'all please, please stop the violence? Freddie Gray would not want this.' Freddie's father and mother do not want any violence. Violence does not get justice.\" Vandals broke and damaged storefront windows and trashed one 7-Eleven, police said. CNN crews observed a window damaged at a Michael Kors store and holes in one at a Subway restaurant. The skirmishes followed a planned demonstration over how police handled the arrest of Gray, a 25-year-old Baltimore man who suffered a spinal injury at some point after he was detained by police on April 12. He died a week later. The numbers of protesters dissipated substantially just before sunset, though some people were still walking in the streets near Oriole Park at Camden Yards, causing some traffic problems. Earlier, demonstrators had marched through the streets until they arrived at City Hall. Along the way, whenever it appeared the protest might get out of control, organizers reined the marchers back in. The event ended after speeches at Baltimore City Hall on Saturday evening, but many protesters continued to vent their anger by marching down to Inner Harbor. When demonstrators got to the stadium, tensions escalated and some people threw what appeared to be water bottles and other objects at the cops, who wore helmets and stood behind metal barricades. Fans who were arriving to watch the hometown Orioles play the Boston Red Sox were having trouble finding ways to the entrance gates. The Orioles won the game 5-4 in extra innings. For a time it appeared that fans would be held inside the ballpark until the demonstration quieted, but the gates were opened before the contest was over. Throughout the day, protesters yelled, \"No justice, no peace\" and \"All night, all day; we're gonna fight for Freddie Gray.\" The police department used Twitter to update the public on the progress of the march. At City Hall, speakers demanded justice for the Gray family and an end to what they called police brutality against black suspects. At least one protest organizer had promised in advance that the event would be big enough to shut down the city, but while many people turned out and walked, the major disruption was only to traffic on a few streets. Gray died last Sunday. Protesters have marched since, outraged by the arrest, which was recorded on a bystander's cell phone and the nature of Gray's death. The witness said Gray was yelling and indicated he was having difficulty breathing. At some point after he was detained, he suffered a severe spinal cord injury. His family said his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and died. On Friday, police officials said that Gray should have received medical care at the site of his arrest and at other times as he was transported to a police station. The van carrying him stopped three times on its way to the station where he was to be booked, but when it arrived at the Western District officers called for an ambulance, which took him to a hospital. The questions investigators are looking into are: How and where did Gray suffer a severe spinal injury? And are police liable for his death? The preliminary work on his autopsy has been done, but the medical examiner's office is waiting on toxicology results and may invite spinal experts to look at the case, authorities said. A full report may take 30 to 45 days. Batts told reporters on Friday there are no excuses for the fact that Gray was not buckled in as he was transported to a police station. He also said officers should have given Gray timely medical care \"multiple times.\" Those comments upset members of the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police. \"We are disappointed in the comments made yesterday by Commissioner Anthony Batts, and various members of his command staff, relative to the actions of the officers directly involved in the Gray investigation,\" Gene Ryan, president of the organization said in a written statement. \"These comments appear to be politically driven and in direct contrast to the commissioner's own request not to jump to any conclusions until the entire investigation is complete.\" Police say five of the six officers involved in the arrest have provided statements to investigators. The sixth officer has invoked his right to refuse to answer questions, Batts said. A wake for Gray will be held Sunday, with a memorial service and funeral following on Monday.

Dave Roberts, who is in the running to become the mayor of Middlesbrough, followed in his great-great-uncle Daniel McAllister's footsteps by leaping off the Transporter Bridge over the River Tees. However, instead of falling to his death like his relative did more than 100 years ago - Mr Roberts survived the jump which he carried out for a children's charity. Dave Roberts, who hopes to become the mayor of Middlesbrough, has bungee jumped off the Transporter Bridge over the River Tees 100 years after his ancestor jumped to his death for a bet worth just a sixpence.

The 50-year-old former TV and radio presenter, from Marton, Middlesbrough, said: 'I thought it was going to be sheer terror, but I actually really enjoyed it. 'I had a good moment just before the jump. The guy was saying, I am going to count to three, and then you are going to jump. 'I said, I need to speak to my relative. I said: \"Daniel, this one's for you. I am going to collect your winnings\". 'I screamed like a child as I was going down, but thoroughly enjoyed it.' Mr McAllister was challenged to jump off the bridge by a friend after drinking in a pub in Port Clarence in a bet worth a sixpence. He died on May 4, 1913 at the age of 30. Newspaper articles from 1913 about Mr McAllister's death (pictured) tell how he 'dived to his death' and drowned following an 'amazing act of bravado' The cause of death was listed as: 'Shock and suffocation from drowning through jumping from the Transporter Bridge in a spirit of bravado whilst under the influence of drink.' Father-of-two Mr Roberts, who grew up listening to stories about his ancestor, managed to track down Mr McAllister's death certificate, which listed him as a general labourer of Washington Street in Middlesbrough. Mr Roberts, who was handed a sixpence and a beer after his jump this week, said: 'A century after Daniel was killed, and in a bid to exorcise the ghost of my ancestor, I decided I would have a go at the jump as well. 'But I wanted to do it as a charity event, and make sure I was safely attached to a bungee rope! 'The Daniel McAllister story has been in the family for over a century. 'No one really believed it to be true as all attempts to link it to the 1913 bridge jump had failed due to searching the wrong line of the family tree. 'Then we found a 1899 marriage certificate of Daniel's sister Emily, which opened a new route and this finally provided the link we needed.' Mr Roberts, who lives with his wife Francesca, 45, and children Kari, 14, and Luke 12, is running for mayor having moved back to England from a job in Singapore 18 months ago where he was vice president of business development for Fox TV. He said: 'This was all fun and games but I am a serious mayoral candidate for the town who has a great sense of humour and I'll be making a lot of serious points in the run-up to the election as I am a Middlesbrough lad who cares deeply about his town. 'Normally town mayors get set for the high jump after their term in office, this one got out of the way before the hard work starts.'

The wing is able to morph itself like that of a bird to provide the same functionality as normal flaps, but with much less weight. It can also reportedly be used to increase fuel efficiency and even reduce noise on take-off and landing. Scroll down for videos. Nasa has been testing a flexible wing on a plane in California (shown). The wing can bend from -2 degrees up to 30 degrees. It means that regular flaps aren't needed - and it is much lighter. In this image, the technology is visible at the flat 'flap at the base of the wing. The latest test of the technology took place above Nasa\u2019s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California. Over the past six months, 22 research flights of the Adaptive Compliant Trailing Edge (ACTE) flight control surface has taken place. The project is a collaboration between Nasa, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and FlexSys from Ann Arbor Michigan. The wing is able to \u2018bend\u2019 through angles from -2 degrees up to 30 degrees. Test pilots have described it as being \u2018very smooth\u2019, while it can also deal with hard banking manoeuvres and extreme temperatures. For all the flights so far, the wing has flown in a fixed position on a Gulfstream III jet between these two extremes, to ensure risk is minimal. But for future flights, the wings will be able to change angles while in the air. The breakthrough could also increase fuel efficiency up to 12 per cent, and reduce noise at take-off and landing up to 40 per cent. The wing is shown above bending through its two extremes.\u00a0The project is a collaboration between Nasa, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and FlexSys Inc from Ann Arbor Michigan.

The company\u2019s vision is to build a vehicle with four rotors that allow it to take to the air anywhere like a helicopter - and then switch to fly like a normal plane. While this \u2018SkyCruiser\u2019 vehicle is still some way from development, the technology could soon become a reality in a functioning prototype dubbed the \u2018SkyProwler\u2019. The SkyProwler has four horizontal propellers that allow it to perform vertical take-offs and landings, and to hover in mid-air. \u2018We are thrilled to have accomplished all of our flight test goals without encountering any significant technical issues,\u2019 said AFRL Program Manager Pete Flick, from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. \u2018These flights cap 17 years of technology maturation, beginning with AFRL\u2019s initial Phase 1 SBIR contract with FlexSys, and the technology now is ready to dramatically improve aircraft efficiency for the Air Force and the commercial aviation industry.\u2019 The technology can be fitted to existing airplane wings, so it does not require a complete redesign of current aircraft wings. \u2018The completion of this flight test campaign at Armstrong is a big step for Nasa's Environmentally Responsible Aviation Project,\u2019 said ERA project manager Fay Collier. \u2018This is the first of eight large-scale integrated technology demonstrations ERA is finishing up this year that are designed to reduce the impact of aviation on the environment.\u2019 It will take years for such a technology to be approved for commercial aircraft, though, so it\u2019s unlikely to be used on planes any time soon.

Mr Dahl's wife, Marguerite Dahl, confirmed on Tuesday that her husband of 40 years died March 23 of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His rocks, which formed a brief but remarkably successful craze for several months in 1975, came packed in a cardboard box containing a tongue-in-cheek instruction pamphlet for 'care and feeding' and made him a millionaire. Gary Dahl, the creator of the wildly popular 1970s fad the Pet Rock, has died at age 78 in southern Oregon. Mr Dahl later estimated he had sold 1.5million of them at roughly $4 each by the time the fad fizzled only a few months after it hit the market. In later years, given his success with the Pet Rock, he authored the self help book Advertising for Dummies. Although its popularity was short-lived, the Pet Rock was no more than a standard rock packaged around an amusing marketing strategy. To this day his creation divides opinion among those who look back on it with contempt, and those who admire his ability to sell it. Born December 18, 1936, in Bottineau, North Dakota, Dahl was raised in Spokane, Washington. In 1975, he was a Los Gatos, California, advertising executive when he came up with the Pet Rock idea. The rock - which was simply a common everyday stone - came with a manual which, tongue in cheek, detailed how the owner should take care of it. It also stated how its owners should make it feel comfortable in its new home, how to train it and how it can be used to attack 'adversaries'. The New York Times reported he was later sued by investors after they claimed they received too small a share of the profits and he was forced to pay a six-figure sum. His later inventions included The Original Sand Breeding Kit and Red China Dirt. However, these failed to take off. Gary Dahl's Pet Rock\u00a0came with a manual which, tongue in cheek, detailed how the owner should take care of it. In 2000, he was a grand prize winner in the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest for dreadful prose. His winning entry read: 'The heather-encrusted Headlands, veiled in fog as thick as smoke in a crowded pub, hunched precariously over the moors, their rocky elbows slipping off land's end, their bulbous, craggy noses thrust into the thick foam of the North Sea like bearded old men falling asleep in their pints.' He and his wife retired and moved to Jacksonville in 2006. The Pet Rock craze 'was great fun when it happened,' his wife recalled in a telephone interview. Over time, however, 'people would come to him with weird ideas, expecting him to do for them what he had done for himself. And a lot of times they were really, really stupid ideas.' By 1988, Dahl said he had avoided interviews for years because of what he called 'a bunch of wackos' appearing out of nowhere with threats and lawsuits. Of the little rock that became a household name, he said, 'Sometimes I look back and wonder if my life wouldn't have been simpler if I hadn't done it.' Mr Dahl designed and built the Carry Nations Saloon in Los Gatos, his wife said. In addition to his wife, he is survived by a sister, Candace Dahl of Spokane; daughters Chris Nunez and Samantha Leighton; son Eric Dahl; stepdaughter Vicki Pershing and grandchildren. Mr Dahl and his wife were avid sailors on San Francisco Bay, where she plans to sprinkle his ashes in May.", "summary": "The Pet Rock creator has died from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Unscrupulous dealers in the UK and abroad are selling the potentially fatal drug, which contains a toxic chemical used in pesticides and explosives, to those desperate to lose weight. Some promise next-day delivery, while others even offer free samples for those who want to \u2018try before they buy\u2019. The most recent victim of the chemical 2,4-Dinitrophenol (DNP) is Eloise Aimee Parry, 21, as reported in yesterday\u2019s Mail. She died this month after buying it online to slim down \u2013 despite being a normal weight. Five others have died since 2008. Yesterday, her mother, Fiona, told how the drug arrived in a \u2018nondescript\u2019 plastic bag labelled with a white sticker embossed with the letters \u2018DNP\u2019 and an illustration of its chemical formula. She found it in her daughter\u2019s handbag after her death in hospital on April 12. Mrs Parry, 51, a chemistry teacher, said the drug was simple to concoct, adding: \u2018A student with a decent grade in A-level chemistry could work out how to synthesise this.\u2019 Despite the dangers, the drug can be bought cheaply and easily online, the Daily Mail discovered yesterday. Simple internet searches found dozens of firms marketing and selling DNP as a miracle diet pill for home delivery in \u2018discreet packaging\u2019. Others based in China were offering the powder contained in the capsules in bulk, allowing anyone to make pills and sell them online. One company claimed to be based in the UK. It had a sale on, with 100 pills for \u00a370. It also offered to send six free tablets to try. Miss Parry, from Shrewsbury, died after taking eight \u2013 six more than the fatal dose. She \u2018burned up from within\u2019, her mother said. DNP, a yellow organic compound, is used to suppress plant growth and as an explosive. It was popular as a diet aid in the 1930s but was banned after it was found to be poisonous. Despite this, it has become popular again, particularly among bodybuilders. It works by causing the body to overheat, accelerating the metabolism so it burns more fat. However it also causes dehydration, nausea, vomiting, excessive sweating and a rapid or irregular heartbeat and can lead to coma and death. Long-term use can lead to the development of cataracts and skin lesions and may cause damage to the heart and nervous system. There is also evidence that DNP causes cancer and increases the risk of birth defects. Bright yellow DNP powder is produced as a pesticide at chemical factories in Turkey and China. It is then made into easy-to-swallow capsules by dealers who sell them online as weight-loss pills. Dozens of websites advertise DNP as a fat-burning wonder drug. They promise discreet, prompt, worldwide delivery. One British website even offers customers a \u2018try before you buy\u2019. What the websites do not say is that DNP has been linked to at least 62 deaths worldwide. Many promise that users can expect to lose 1lb of fat every day on the drug. Some websites include the disclaimer \u2018Research purposes only, not for human consumption\u2019 but still sell the drug in capsule form. Produced as a pesticide: Yellow DNP powder. It is illegal to sell for human consumption, but sellers get around this by claiming to sell it as a pesticide or dye, which is not illegal, or with disclaimers. There is little British authorities can do because most firms are based or registered overseas. Miss Parry, who was bulimic, was a families and childcare studies student at Glyndwr University in Wrexham, north Wales. On April 12 she drove herself to A&E after taking eight pills and becoming unwell. Within three hours, she was dead. Mrs Parry said she had no idea her daughter had been taking slimming pills until she arrived at A&E to be told by doctors she had died. Police are investigating the source of Miss Parry\u2019s tablets. However, the British website found by the Mail, which was decorated with Union Flags, offered next-day delivery and said the pills were \u2018the most powerful and effective weight-loss tool available\u2019, claiming customers could lose 1lb a day. It added: \u2018Used correctly, there is simply nothing like it.\u2019 Other firms are based in Turkey, the US and Russia. In almost all cases, it is impossible to trace those behind the websites because they are registered to offshore host companies. The National Poisons Information Service said there were just six enquiries from GPs about DNP in 2012 \u2013 a year later there were 300. Referring to online merchants, Mrs Parry, a single mother of five, said: \u2018They don\u2019t care about the damage they inflict, about the pain and suffering of the people who take this stuff and pay a price for it.\u2019 The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency cannot take action against manufacturers or distributors because DNP is not classified as a medicinal product. In theory, the Food Standards Authority could act if DNP was sold for human consumption. But most firms are registered abroad so they fall outside its jurisdiction. Victims\u2019 families have been campaigning for DNP to be classified as an illegal drug, and in 2013, David Cameron promised to \u2018look carefully\u2019 at the issue. But in March the Home Office told an MP it would not make the drug illegal because it contains no \u2018psychoactive\u2019 properties.

Jade and Aaron Badland asked an Asian family if they had Ebola and assaulted a Brazilian hotel employee, calling her a 'bloody foreigner'. The pair have been spared jail after a court heard that they were too drunk to remember what they had done at the Premier Inn at Stansted Airport. Assault: Aaron and Jade Badland have admitted assaulting a hotel worker after their wedding reception. Mr Badland, 24, a bomb disposal officer in the Engineering Regiment, was wearing his Army uniform during the drunken attack alongside his 29-year-old bride. Both newlyweds pleaded guilty to assault and were each ordered to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work, while Mrs Badland was also found guilty of racially aggravated harassment. Chelmsford Magistrates' Court heard that the couple got married in Malta last August, but held their wedding reception at Audley End, Essex in November. Afterwards they were staying at the Stansted branch of Premier Inn, where American guest David La Plante saw them abusing an Asian family. He told the court: 'Around the corner by some lifts we heard talk and the wife was making derogatory remarks to the family, calling them foreigners and asking if they had the Ebola virus. 'I positioned myself between her and the family and gave her a look saying \"enough is enough\". She asked me if I had the Ebola virus and my response was, \"Do you?\" 'Her husband came around, wrapped her up and told her we were Americans and not to talk to us.' Venue: The assault took place at a branch of Premier Inn in Stansted Airport, pictured. Harry Coleman, prosecuting, told the court that the Badlands staggered to their hotel room but could not work out how to use the electronic key. They then confronted Brazilian worker Christina Periera, but Mr Badland became angry when she told them she would have to reprogramme the key in order to open their door. Mr Badland then told Mrs Pereira: 'It's my room, open the f***ing door - bloody foreigners coming to our country.' Mr Coleman said: 'Ms Periera was upset and said she was going down to call the police, and he hit her on the nose with his open palm and again twice more.' Mrs Badland 'prodded' the worker with two bottles of alcohol as her husband continued to shout, the court heard. She told magistrates: 'I had a lot of drink. I had a good few pints and some shots and don't remember anything about the incident because of the level of intoxication. I was very drunk.'

One group received a mildly pleasurable experience at the end of the procedure; the other group, which experienced the same type of colonoscopy, did not. It turns out that the group for whom things ended well had significantly more positive recollections of the whole affair from its beginning. The psychology of it is simple to understand: Happy endings matter. Even an unpleasant experience can lead to happy memories in hindsight if it ends well. So too with taxes. Let's just say that when it comes to taxes for the average American, \"stuff\" happens (keeping the colonoscopy metaphor running), paycheck to tax-reduced paycheck. But recent statistics suggest that 8 out of 10 American taxpayers get a refund when they file their taxes, and the average amount is close to $3000. That pays for a lot of stuff. To make the good news even better, tax filing has gotten rather simple for most people, with various software and service providers offering to do the dreaded paperwork for free. No filing headaches and a check to boot. What's not to like? The fact of the matter is there is plenty not to like when it comes to the U.S. tax system. For example, the laws are biased against two-worker marriages; taxes go up when two relatively equal earners marry, as the rate brackets for couples are less than double that for single filers. Taxes are also overly complex and essentially optional for the truly rich, who make their wealth off of their existing wealth, the largely untaxed returns from capital, rather than by getting ordinary paychecks like most of us. But now is not the time to explain such serious matters; the people are too busy spending their refunds. The once dreaded Tax Day has become a happy spending spree for most Americans. This state of short-term bliss follows from some deep trends in our tax laws. In brief, the U.S. income tax system is increasingly a wage tax, with limited taxes on capital (what the rich have) and limited deductions for most of us. For example, 3 out of 4 Americans using a standard deduction get no break for their charitable contributions. All of this has been hashed and rehashed by politicians, professors and pundits. But who has time for that? Let's go to our television sets and check out the commercials. One clever spot ran during the recent Super Bowl, suggesting that the Boston Tea Party -- a tax revolt -- could have been averted with free online filing, which the sponsor was eager to provide. Filling out 1040s was part of what made the income tax so odious for the masses for such a long time -- who doesn't remember our parents fretting over shoeboxes of receipts sometime in April, the cruelest month? Now as Tax Day approaches, we are flooded with advertisements about America getting its billions back, without even having to pay to prepare the forms. We get paid to play! Here is the happy ending that Kahneman and others have shown can mitigate the memories of unpleasantness past. The simple fact is that a simple tax is also rather simple to administer. Service providers kindly offer to help out the masses of befuddled Americans. Of course, these kind souls want their happy endings too. They are betting that once the large refunds become obvious to their customers, the grateful taxpayers-turned-consumers will happily purchase add-on services, such as \"audit protection insurance,\" or perhaps deposit the money in financial accounts managed by the provider. Just as lottery winners notoriously go on impulsive spending sprees, the \"found money\" of tax returns can finance many nice purchases. Of course, there are still those annoying matters of the deep unfairness of the tax laws, biased against modern families and wage earners, and in favor of the rich living off capital. No real bother -- stuff happens. Let others fret about fairness. As long as our taxpaying or colon procedures end with a smile -- or a check -- who has time to dwell on the bad stuff that came before?", "summary": "Edward McCaffery: There's a fundamental unfairness to U.S. tax laws.

Siberian tigers were once found throughout the Russian Far East, northern China, and the Korean peninsula but by the 1940s, hunting had driven the species, also known as the Amur tiger, to the brink of extinction with no more than 40 individuals remaining in the wild. While the population has now stabilised somewhat, sightings in the wild are extremely rare as the tigers have the largest home range of any tiger subspecies and a limited density of prey means they have to search over large areas to find food.

Early Wednesday morning, Taylor sat in an Illinois jail. Hiding outside his cell. Ready to pounce. When he did, his victim was a correctional officer making his rounds, according to Kankakee County Sheriff Timothy Bukowski. Taylor beat up the guard, put on his uniform and took his keys. He then walked out of the jail's door and into the officer's brown 2012 Chevrolet Equinox SUV. Where the 23-year-old, who was set to be sentenced in May, is now is anybody's guess. The Equinox was discovered around 8:30 a.m. (9:30 a.m. ET) in Kankakee, but without any sign of the convicted murderer who drove it. Looking for Taylor is job No. 1 for authorities. No. 2 is figuring out how he managed to first get out of his cell, then get out of the Jerome Combs Detention Center and on the lam. \"The question for us is where did (the county correctional system) break down,\" Bukowski said. \"It looks right now (like) somebody didn't do their job properly.\" What authorities do know is based on video, other evidence and interviews with witnesses -- namely other inmates at the Kankakee jail. What they don't know is how Taylor got out of his two-man cell, when he should have been locked down. But somehow he did, and hid. \"And then when the opportunity arose, he attacked the officer,\" Bukowski said, noting that Taylor \"attacked from the side\" around 3 a.m. \"Beat him, choked him.\" He then apparently disrobed the guard, a military veteran and 10-year employee of the corrections department. The guard was left on the jail floor, going in and out of consciousness, for about 35 minutes before authorities -- concerned because the guard hadn't responded to calls -- found him, the sheriff said. \"They then called the ambulance and we were notified and put out an alert,\" added Bukowski. By then, Taylor was gone. He'd pushed a button to notify \"master control\" that he wanted to leave, which means his identity would have been checked by camera. \"We think that because he had the officer's uniform on,\" the sheriff explained, \"that's how he was able to effectively escape.\" Taylor walked out the door and into the detention center's parking lot, where, authorities said, he clicked the correctional officer's key fob to find the Chevy Equinox. That officer is now in an intensive care unit at St. Mary's Hospital in Kankakee, Bukowski said. The manhunt, meanwhile, continues for Taylor. He has a history of trouble with the law that predates his murder conviction, including an August 2009 sentence of five years, 10 months in Tennessee for robbery and resisting arrest. Taylor was on parole for that crime when he killed a man during a June 2013 botched robbery. A jury convicted him of murder in that incident in late February. After the verdict was read, Taylor sat down, looked back, then got up and ran, according to The Daily Journal in Kankakee.

Von Shirach was only 18 when he met Hitler in Munich in 1925. He quickly moved up the National Socialist ranks through his leadership of the Nazi students association. In 1945 he was tried at Nuremberg and sentenced to 20 years in Berlin-Spandau prison. He died in 1974. Photographer Hoffmann died in 1957.

Hormone replacement therapy increases a woman's risk of breast cancer up to eight years after she has stopped treatment, scientists have warned. The new findings come from experts who conducted one of the world's largest studies into the effects of HRT - used to ease the effects of menopause. The Women's Health Initiative in the US and the Million Women Study in the UK have both revealed strong evidence that HRT increases a woman's risk of breast, womb and ovarian cancers. The Million Women Study, a collaboration between Cancer Research UK and the NHS, results suggested that women who are using combined HRT have double the risk of breast cancer compared to non-users. And researchers found if women use HRT for more than 10 years, their risks are even higher. Now scientists involved in the Women's Health Initiative study have warned, after further follow-ups, that women who take the combined oestrogen and progesterone HRT therapy continue to have a high risk of breast cancer, up to eight years after they stop treatment. After going through the menopause a woman's ovaries stop producing the hormone oestrogen. It triggers menopausal symptoms including hot flashes and mood swings. HRT treats the body by introducing female sex hormones. There are three types, oestrogen-only HRT, cyclical HRT \u00a0- where oestrogen is taken continuously but progesterone is given either monthly or every three months - and continuous combined HRT, where both female sex hormones are taken at the same time. In the early 1990s, some smaller studies suggested the therapy would reduce a woman's risk of coronary heart disease and osteoporosis. To examine whether that was the case, the Women's Health Initiative in the US was tasked with investigating. They enrolled more than 26,000 women aged 50 to 79 in the study. Meanwhile, in the UK \u00a0another key study, the Million Women Study, explored the effects of HRT on women aged 50 or over. Both concluded that women prescribed HRT were at a higher risk of breast cancer, than those not receiving the treatment. WHI researchers had intended to follow the women up until 2005, but in 2002 it became clear women taking HRT were suffering higher rates of heart disease. Those women who took the combined HRT, which boosts the body's levels of both female sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone, have an increased risk of breast cancer up to eight years after treatment. They discovered it was the women taking either the combination HRT or those taking oestrogen-only treatment that were going on to suffer heart problems. As a result, all women were asked to stop taking their treatment - HRT or placebo - immediately. After the reported increased risk in breast cancer for women taking combined HRT, use of the therapy dropped dramatically. The new study, led by Dr Rowan Chlebowski, an oncologist at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, and one of the initial investigators on WHI, focused on a woman's risk of breast cancer after stopping HRT treatment. He told Time: 'It looks like hormones have longer term lingering effects. 'For oestrogen and progesterone together, we see an increase in risk - even years after you stop. 'But for oestrogen alone, it looks like the hormone may be more favourable in reducing breast cancer risk than we thought before. 'The oestrogen alone findings are now quite compelling that we may have to call it risk reduction.' In total, researchers examined 27,347 women aged 50 to 79 years old, who had been through the menopause. They had all taken part in two previous WHI studies, having enrolled at 40 centres across the US from 1993 to 1998. The Women's Health Initiative in the US and the Million Women Study in the UK are the two largest studies into the effects of HRT. Both found strong evidence the treatment increases a woman's risk of breast cancer, pictured, with the latter finding it doubled a woman's risk. In the first two years, after stopping HRT treatment, researchers noted a sharp decrease in breast cancer risk in those women who had taken both oestrogen and progesterone. But the study authors noted: 'Subsequently, breast cancer risk increased throughout the intervention phase and became statistically significant.' Even up to five-and-a-half years later, breast cancer risk remained high. In addition, the researchers note that at an eight-year follow-up a 'risk reduction was not observed'. But for those women taking oestrogen only treatment, the risk for invasive breast cancer fell. However, despite the findings, Dr Chlebowski urged caution. He said while the results do show a higher than normal risk of breast cancer years after stopping HRT, it is only 'a little more risk than we thought with oestrogen and progesterone'. 'But it's always difficult to figure out how to categorise that risk,' he added. 'It's different for each woman.'", "summary": "HRT increase risk of disease up to eight years after stopping treatment. Applies to those taking combined HRT - oestrogen and progesterone.

Leeds fans voiced their wholehearted backing for head coach Neil Redfearn and his sacked assistant Steve Thompson. Loud chants of 'there's only one Neil Redfearn' and 'there's only one Steve Thompson' rang out around the ground soon after the start. Just two days earlier, Redfearn angrily said he was considering his future after Thompson was mysteriously suspended for the remainder of the season and told his contract would not be renewed. Thompson was informed of his suspension by Leeds' football director Nicola Salerno, who is believed to be considering his own position. Blackburn, who had 19-year-old Spanish keeper David Raya on debut, withstood early pressure before almost taking a 13th-minute lead when Rhodes shot against the bar and Marshall fired the rebound into the side-netting. Jordan Rhodes nets the second for Blackburn Rovers against Leeds United. Rhodes then produced a neat turn but shot over from eight yards and when Austin had Leeds' best chance so far, he nodded Charlie Taylor's cross over the bar before leaving Leeds to battle on with 10 men. Raya had been largely untested on his debut, his only first-half save keeping out Sam Byram's acute angled shot, but Leeds keeper Marco Silvestri had to pull off a desperate stop from Rudy Gestede at point-blank range in the 49th minute. Rovers had struggled to make their numerical advantage count as Leeds employed tight marking, with strikers Rhodes and Gestede starved of clear-cut opportunities, but two goals in a seven-minute spell turned the game Rovers' way. The breakthrough arrived in the 62nd minute. Lee Williamson's long pass down the right found Gestede who gave Giuseppe Bellusci the slip before Cairney shot powerfully past Silvestri. Gestede limped off to be replaced by Chris Brown in the 64th minute and a minute later Marshall's long-distance shot smacked against a post. Leeds were rocking and they conceded again in the 69th minute. Cairney picked out Brown, whose accurate cross left the unmarked Rhodes the simple task of heading home for his 17th goal of the season.

But their brand of psychedelic rock conjures up a world a far cry from her life in Downing Street and the Cotswolds. The American band \u2013 whose name roughly translates as \u2018policy\u2019 in Polish \u2013 are inspired by a radical feminist who described pregnancy as \u2018barbaric\u2019, and their songs feature violent imagery. The video for the first single on the group\u2019s most recent album depicts androgynous-looking singer Channy Leaneagh subjecting her trussed-up alter ego to a violent assault. Blood spurts in all directions as she smashes her hands with a hammer, punches her in the face and finally waterboards her. Another unsettling song by the four-piece band from Minnesota, entitled Leading To Death, includes the lyric \u2018I dream of you, oh my strangler\u2019. Miss Leaneagh, 33, has described her music as \u2018rhythm-driven sex noise\u2019 and says the digital effects she uses to modify her broken-hearted vocals are \u2018like taking drugs for your voice\u2019.

The record\u2019s cover is illustrated with a photograph of a naked young woman, her hair and neck caked in blood. The title is a tribute to Canadian-born feminist Shulamith Firestone, whom Miss Leaneagh has described as a \u2018mentor and muse from the grave\u2019. Miss Firestone, who died in 2012 aged 67, painted a radical vision of a \u2018liberated\u2019 world without families, childbirth or any real distinctions between men and women. She is best known for her 1970 manifesto The Dialectic Of Sex: The Case For Feminist Revolution, which drew inspiration from Karl Marx\u2019s Communist Manifesto.

Experts have dated the coin to between 300 BC and 264 BC and say it came from the Western Mediterranean - probably Sardinia or ancient Carthage.

On one side of the coin there the image of the Goddess Tanit, the chief deity of Carthage, (pictured left) while on the reverse is a horse\u2019s head, pictured right. The find suggests that the village of Saltford (shown on the map with a red marker), where the coin was found, was on a major trade route long before Roman times.

One side of the coin shows an image of the Carthaginian goddess Tanit, \u00a0suggesting links between the south west and the Mediterranean. The coin is thought to be the oldest dateable evidence of human activity found in Saltford and the West of England. It suggests Iron Age links between the Mediterranean and the Bristol Channel, which the River Avon flows into around 15 miles (24km) away. Professor David Mattingly, an archaeologist and Roman historian at the University of Leicester said: \u2018It\u2019s really interesting to have a Carthaginian coin in Britain. \u2018Suppose that coin was deposited close to its minting - at the time, there were no coins being used in Britain. It would have been quite alien to people. \u2018We are very sure that horses were important at the time so that may have invoked a lot of interest back then. It\u2019s a very interesting find.\u2019 Phil Harding of the Saltford Environment Group, said that the coin\u2019s significant because it is one of the oldest coins ever to be found in England. \u2018Only eight of these have ever been found, always on ancient trade routes,\u2019 he said. \u2018We can\u2019t believe it.

'The coins would suggest a serious amount of wealth and power of the individual who owned them. \u2018Coins were used more as a symbol of power and status during the Late Iron Age, rather than for buying and selling staple foods and supplies. \u2018...The situation of the cave can\u2019t be ignored either.

Doubts over Arsenal\u2019s ability to fund a move for Sterling have seen their interest questioned, but they are confident they have the financial firepower to compete for him. In addition to the English trio, Sterling is also attracting interest from Europe \u2014 with Real Madrid and Bayern Munich monitoring developments. However, Rodgers reminded Sterling that it was Liverpool who made him the player he is today, saying he should be \u2018honoured\u2019 to represent the club. He refused to say whether the player will face disciplinary action after admitting the club had been caught off guard by the interview. Rodgers reminded England international Sterling it is Liverpool who have made him the player he is today. \u2018There was no permission by the club, it was something that surprised us all,\u2019 added Rodgers. \u2018It\u2019s part of the modern game. People who look after players and represent them have different ways of working. I\u2019ve seen that over the years. \u2018The last time we sat down it was the intention of the player and his representatives, and also the club, to put (contract talks) on hold. Obviously, Raheem has come out and made his feelings clear on that and hopefully now the focus will be on the football. \u2018He\u2019s a young player who is still learning and developing on and off the field. Sometimes you make mistakes as a youngster. \u2018Our relationship is strong, which is important.

The Boy Scouts' Greater New York Councils said they hired Pascal Tessier, an 18-year-old Eagle Scout who has been a vocal advocate of opening the 105-year-old organization to gay scouts and leaders. Board member Richard G. Mason said the councils see Tessier as 'an exemplary candidate for employment as a camp leader.' Scroll down for video. Boy Scout Pascal Tessier, 18, center left, and his brother Lucien Tessier, 20, who had earned the rank of Eagle Scout, pose for a portrait with their parents, Oliver Tessier, left, and Tracie Felker, at their home. On Thursday the Boy Scouts New York chapter announced it hired Pascal Tessier as the nation's first openly gay Eagle Scout as a summer camp leader. 'We welcome him,' Mason said in a statement. The Boy Scouts of America didn't immediately respond to an inquiry about the hire. The national organization changed its policy in 2013 to allow openly gay kids as scouts, but not adults as leaders, after a bitter debate over its membership policy. The change took effect in January 2014. Advocates for letting gays participate in scouting hailed Tessier's hire. 'This is a watershed moment,' Zach Wahls, executive director of Scouts for Equality, said in a statement. 'We are proud to see such an important Boy Scout council standing up for the full inclusion of gay members.' When the national Boy Scouts began allowing gay boys as scouts, liberal Scout leaders and gay rights groups celebrated the shift but called for allowing gay adults to participate, too. Conservatives involved with the Scouts, including some churches that sponsor troops, decried letting any gays \u2014 including kids \u2014 participate, and some threatened to defect if the ban were lifted. The Boy Scouts of America has said it doesn't \"proactively inquire\" about members' sexual orientation \u2014 in effect, a form of 'don't ask, don't tell.' Tessier's hiring is in contrast to the national scouting organization\u00eds ban on openly gay adult members. But it has expelled adults who were open about it, including a gay troop leader in Seattle who was removed last year after he disclosed his orientation during a TV interview. Regardless, some local Boy Scout councils have let it be known they are open to gay employees, but the New York councils' move presents an unusually acute departure from the national policy. The 103-year-old New York group says it has never denied membership to a youth or adult based on sexual orientation, and it didn't want its policy to be affected by the national group's stance. The New York councils serve over 46,000 scouts. Tessier achieved scouting's highest rank last year after being one of the most prominent openly gay scouts speaking out to change the ban on gay participation. The Kensington, Maryland, teen said then he was relieved finally to have his Eagle badge approved by the Scouts' national headquarters in Irving, Texas. 'Even if I had been kicked out along the way, I wouldn't have changed anything,' he said. 'The whole experience was something worth having, not only for myself but also for all the other people involved \u2014 and for all the people it affects.'", "summary": "The Boy Scouts' Greater New York Councils said they hired Pascal Tessier, an 18-year-old Eagle Scout.

The Prime Minister said the Scottish National Party would prop up a minority Labour administration in the hope that the government would be a 'disaster' and bring forward its dream of independence. But Liberal Democrat Cabinet minster Danny Alexander accused the Prime Minister of 'playing with fire' by stirring up ill-feeling between Scotland and England in a way that would only fuel support for independence in next year's Scottish Parliament elections. Scroll down for video. David Cameron, addressing supporters in Somerset this afternoon, has warned voters that they have '11 days to save Britain', as he claimed Scottish nationalists 'don't want the country to succeed' The Prime Minister - taking a selfie with supporters today, said the Scottish National Party would prop up a minority Labour administration in the hope that the government would be a 'disaster' and bring forward its dream of independence. The warnings came as polls indicated that the General Election race was still neck and neck, with the UK heading for a hung parliament and coalition negotiations after May 7. A Survation poll put the Conservatives three points ahead on 33 per cent to Labour's 30 per cent. However, other polls had Labour nudging ahead. Today's Survation poll found that more than a third of English voters would not regard a Miliband administration propped up by the SNP as 'legitimate'. More than two-fifths - 44 per cent - meanwhile said that they would rather see England break away from Scotland than have an arrangement of this kind. Mr Cameron told the Sunday Express that an outright Conservative victory could make Britain 'one of the great international success stories of the next decade'. The Prime Minister echoed Tony Blair's 'education, education, education' slogan when he said his three top priorities would be 'economy, economy, economy'. But he warned: 'There are 11 days left to save the economy, to save jobs, effectively to save Britain.' A Survation poll has put the Conservatives three points ahead on 33 per cent to Labour's 30 per cent. Mr Cameron was interviewed on the Murnaghan programme, broadcast this morning, warning of the threat posed by the SNP. Mr Cameron said that the SNP 'want to achieve the break-up of our country, so therefore if you have a Labour government backed by the SNP, you have got a government backed by people who don't want the country to succeed. 'They don't want parliament to succeed. They don't want the government to succeed. They don't want the United Kingdom to succeed. That is really worrying.' Nicola Sturgeon and her predecessor Alex Salmond will want voters to look back after five years of a minority Labour adminstration made possible by the SNP and think 'that was a disaster, now can we break up the United Kingdom altogether?', said the Prime Minister. Mr Alexander was highly critical of the Conservatives' decision to focus their election campaign on the threat of Scottish nationalism. Ed Miliband, appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr show this morning, insisted Labour would not do any deals with the SNP. The Labour leader is under growing pressure to rule out governing with the support of SNP MPs. The Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury told The Observer: 'I think the Tory campaign has been a total disgrace. I think they are deliberately trying to stir up ill-feeling between Scotland and England in a desperate attempt to fend off Ukip and I think it has long-term consequences. When you stoke tensions, you are playing with fire.' Mr Alexander added: 'I think a majority Tory government would be a disaster for the whole of the United Kingdom because it would lurch this country to the right economically... but it would be a particular disaster in Scotland, because it would give the SNP what they most want. - a grievance to nurse for the Scottish parliamentary election in 2016.' And former Liberal leader Lord Steel told the paper: 'The truth is that a new Tory government dependent on Ukip sympathisers in their own midst is a greater threat to the unity of the UK than any band of SNP MPs.'", "summary": "PM says a minority Labour administration would be propped up by the SNP.

Diet Pepsi will no longer contain the sweetener aspartame due to customer fears over its safety. The controversial sweetener has been linked to a range of health problems, although research has shown it to be safe. PepsiCo said today it is dropping the ingredient from the popular drink in the U.S. in response to customer feedback. Diet Pepsi, Caffeine-Free Diet Pepsi and Wild Cherry Diet Pepsi will now contain sucralose, another artificial sweetener commonly known as Splenda. The decision to swap sweeteners comes as after a decade of plummeting sales. Consumers have shifted away from diet drinks because of perceived health concerns about artificial sweeteners, specifically aspartame. The ingredient, used in fizzy drinks and diet products, has been at the centre of critical reports dating back decades linking it to everything from cancer to premature birth. This is despite the Food and Drug Administration stating that more than 100 studies support aspartame's safety. However these assurances have failed to convince some people, who continue to report adverse reactions, such as headaches and nausea after consuming foods containing the sweetener. The sweetener, which is about 200 times sweeter than sugar, is widely used to sweeten diet sodas. It is also used by rival Coca-Cola Co in its drinks such as Diet Coke, Coke Zero and Schweppes Diet Lemonade. In a statement today, PepsiCo said: 'Diet cola drinkers in the U.S. told us they wanted aspartame-free Diet Pepsi and we're delivering.' The reformulated drinks will begin appearing on shelves in August. Sales in PepsiCo's beverage business have been hurt by a long-term decline in soft drink sales in the United States. And Coca-Cola said this week that sales volume for Diet Coke fell 5 percent in North America in the first three months of the year. Executives at Coke and Pepsi blame the declines on perceptions that aspartame, first sold under the brand name Nutrasweet, is not safe. Consumers have shifted away from diet drinks because of perceived health concerns about artificial sweeteners, specifically aspartame. Despite aspartame's poor reputation, it has been ruled a safe food ingredient by food watchdogs in Britain, the EU, the USA and around the world. Last month, a study commissioned by Britain\u2019s food watchdog found eating the sweetener had no impact on the body or behaviour of people who claimed to be sensitive to it. Aspartame has established itself as an important component in many low-calorie, sugar-free foods and beverages and is primarily responsible for the growth over the last two decades in the sugar-free market. It is currently consumed by over 200 million people around the world and is found in more than 6,000 products. These include carbonated soft drinks, powdered soft drinks, chewing gum, dessert mixes, puddings and fillings, frozen desserts, yogurt, tabletop sweeteners, and some pharmaceuticals such as vitamins and sugar-free cough drops. Aspartame is a nutritive sweetener made by joining two amino acids (protein components) -- L-phenylalanine and L-aspartic acid, with a third component called a methyl ester group. Very little is needed for a sweet taste, making aspartame virtually non-caloric. 180 to 200 times sweeter than sucrose. Source: http://www.aspartame.org/. The research had been evaluated by independent experts, peer reviewed and published in the journal PLOS ONE. In December 2013, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published an opinion on aspartame following a full risk assessment and concluded it was \u2018safe for human consumption at current levels of exposure'. This was supported by Britain\u2019s Committee on Toxicity which said the sweetener was safe and there was no need for action, such as taking it off the shelves, to protect public health. But Erik Millstone, Professor of Science Policy at the University of Sussex, insists there is good quality independent research which raises safety concerns. An EU funded project published in 2010 found pregnant women who down cans of fizzy drink containing artificial sweeteners appear to be at greater risk of having a premature baby. It is rare for a mother to be to give birth early - before 37 weeks - assuming all aspects of the pregnancy have been normal. The research found this low risk was increased by 38 per cent if the woman was drinking an average of one can of diet drink a day. The statistics, gathered by academics in Denmark, showed that a woman who routinely drank at least four cans a day could increase the risk by as much as 78 per cent. This meant that if the risk of a premature birth was normally one in a 100, it increased to 1.78 in 100. The professor also highlighted work by the independent Ramazzini Foundation in Italy. Scientist there have published research suggesting aspartame caused several types of cancer in rats at doses very close to the current acceptable daily intake for humans. Despite having virtually, if any calories, But low-calorie artificial sweeteners actually raise the risk of obesity, researchers fear. The popular sugar alternatives found in diet drinks and in sachets in cafes and restaurants may also increase the odds of diabetes. The sweeteners under the microscope are saccharin, which is found in Sweet\u2019N Low, sucralose, which is found in Splenda, and aspartame, which is found in many diet drinks. The Israeli researchers warned that \u2018today\u2019s massive, unsupervised consumption\u2019 of artificial sweeteners needs to be reassessed.", "summary": "Aspartame\u00a0has been linked to a range of health problems.

An Asda manager orchestrated a scam that used the supermarket's own delivery service to steal goods worth more than \u00a315,000 - then managed to land a job at Lidl after he was sacked. Michael Gridley, 26, was jailed after running the scam where stock including\u00a0alcohol, cigarettes, DVDs, computer games and consoles were taken from the store in Basildon, Essex, where he worked. Southend Crown Court heard how the conspiracy was uncovered, following a period during which Gridley and colleague Jay Reed were under suspicion. Thomas Daniel, prosecuting, told the court that goods, ranging from televisions to baby formula, were delivered to Reed's address and presumably sold on. He said: 'Two anonymous reports were received by Asda, one of which suggested Mr Gridley was involved in selling items believed to have been stolen, such as TVs and baby formula. 'When Mr Gridley was ill for a certain period of time, those deliveries stopped, and when he recovered they started again. 'Another email suggested stolen goods being delivered to the address of Mr Gridley's cousin.' But shockingly, after being sacked from the store, Gridley managed to land a managerial role at Lidl in Romford, Essex. Gridley, who was former home shopping manager of the store, was sentenced to 12 months for his leading role in a conspiracy to steal \u00a315,852.46 worth of goods between November 2013 and April last year. The court heard that Reed and another defendant James Munyard had been pressured into taking part in the scam by\u00a0Gridley, who was their superior. Stock including alcohol, cigarettes were taken from shelves and delivered to addresses using the supermarket's own home delivery service. File photo. Section leader Reed, 23, and Munyard, 21, both avoided prison, but were given suspended sentences of eight and four months, respectively. Mitchell Cohen, representing Munyard, told the court that his client, whose role was confined to taking items off shelves and putting them in a crate, had attempted to be transferred from the store in order to escape Gridley's control. James Munyard (pictured) avoided jail for his part in the scam. Reed was deemed to have been in a position of trust and responsibility in the criminal enterprise, but Recorder Gerard Pounder said he had a lesser role than Gridley, 26, and Munyard even less so. Despite hearing Gridley, of Tilbury, financially supported his former partner and their two-year-old child but also his own father and grandparents, Recorder Pounder said he had no choice but to send him to prison. He said: 'You were in a position of supreme trust and you say you started this because of threats made regarding a drug debt of your cousin's, you continued even as those threats faded, and brought other people in, too.' Sentencing Reed to eight months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, and 200 hours' unpaid work, he said: 'You were in a lesser role than Mr Gridley but you were a section leader and had responsibilities. 'In that respect you were somebody who knew the system and it was to your premises these items were taken - without that and your part in the enterprise, it would not have worked.' Munyard, who Mr Cohen said 'didn't have the spine to stand up to what he was being asked to do,' was sentenced to four months' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months, and 100 hours' unpaid work.

German detectives have been \u2018closely monitoring developments\u2019 in the \u00a360 million London case and are expected to make contact with Scotland Yard this week. In particular, they are keen to find out whether any DNA was recovered from the scene of the Easter weekend raid and, crucially, whether it matches forensic samples found in a tunnel used in a \u00a38.3 million robbery at the Volksbank in Steglitz, Berlin, in January 2013. The culprits behind the Hatton Garden raid (pictured) may have carried out a similarly audacious burglary just two years earlier in Berlin, it has emerged. In a case which has strikingly similar traits to the \u00a360m heist in London, thieves targeted 294 security vaults during a break-in at the Volksbank in Steglitz, Berlin, in January 2013. There has been speculation that the London robbers \u2013 who stole jewels and cash from 72 boxes at the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit centre \u2013 are from Eastern Europe. Meanwhile, it is believed the Volksbank raiders, who have never been caught, are Polish. One of the five-man gang left a book at the crime scene \u2013 a Polish translation of American Desperado, the autobiography of drug smuggler Jon Roberts. And wooden boards used for their 100ft tunnel were bought in Poland. Thomas Neuendorf, of Berlin Police, told The Mail on Sunday: \u2018We are very interested in the case in England and I\u2019m sure our investigators will get in touch\u2026 If DNA matching our samples is put into the Interpol database by Scotland Yard we will be immediately notified.\u2019 Suspects caught on CCTV during the London heist were also dressed as construction workers - a tactic used in the Berlin raid. In a similar fashion to the German heist, the burglars timed their raid over the Easter bank holiday, entering after the premises emptied on Thursday night and leaving on Easter Sunday. In the German case, the gang spent almost a year building their tunnel before drilling through the bank\u2019s 3ft-thick concrete walls. In London, the robbers used heavy-duty drills to bore holes into a reinforced 7ft-thick wall. In both cases, police are investigating the possibility of an insider helping the thieves. Scotland Yard declined to comment last night. Value of items taken, including jewels, said to be between \u00a360m and \u00a3200m.

After singing a few lines, he said: 'That translated into England means \"I'm gonna beat Floyd Mayweather's face in\".' The boxer was nevertheless impressed, and a little amused. After Kimmel's effort sung in the Tagalog, a language spoken by about 57 million of the Philippines' more than 98 million people, went viral Pacman took to Twitter to thank the comedian for singing his song. Pacquiao's 80s-style music video includes a montage of the boxer's fights and his humanitarian efforts.

'You were practicing hard for that song. I am excited to be in your show next week. Thank you so much to all your support.' Pacquiao's song translates to English as 'I Will Fight For The Fillipino' and will be blasted through the MGM Grand Arena on May 2 before he bids to end Mayweather's 47-fight unbeaten run.

Ten years on from his career-defining captaincy in the 2005 Ashes, Vaughan is the hot favourite to be appointed as director of England cricket, a streamlined version of the managing director's job which was abolished with Paul Downton's sacking on Wednesday. The 40-year-old has previously kept his distance from a formal role with the ECB, preferring to focus on his burgeoning media profile and business interests, but has declared himself open to discussions about the new post. Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen believes Michael Vaughan is the right man to lead England Cricket. Pietersen received the lion's share of attention during a photocall for his new club Surrey. The controversial star and Vaughan were England team-mates before Pietersen was axed by the ECB. Vaughan would be a pioneering presence, having spoken with passion and candour about the need to accept England's failings and press for change at all costs. That may yet prove good news for the exiled Pietersen. The controversial batsman has largely kept his counsel on the demise of Downton, whose first act in the job was to sack Pietersen last February. But he did tell BreatheSport that his 2005 Ashes captain Vaughan had the credentials to replace him. 'He (Vaughan) is close enough to the game to make changes which need to happen for the good of English cricket,' Pietersen said. 'The way he captained shows he'll change the brand of cricket currently being played, which we need.' Vaughan has previously concentrated on his media duties but is believed to be open to the role. The former England captain speaks with Stuart Broad during last summer's Test series with India. Vaughan holds the urn after England famously reclaimed the Ashes against Australia in 2005. Pietersen may not have played international cricket for well over a year but his shadow looms large over the current turmoil surrounding England. Downton's troubled reign was defined by the decision to martyr Pietersen after the 2013/14 Ashes. The ECB board met at Lord's on Thursday, but there was no official word on the recruitment process. Instead a short statement merely confirmed that Giles Clarke's move from chairman to president had been rubber-stamped, with Middlesex deputy chairman Ian Lovett nominated as vice-chairman. Clarke will become the first ECB president on May 14, a role that carries responsibility for ICC business, while his old post will go to Colin Graves. Graves was the man who gave new legs to Pietersen's mooted comeback when he appeared to suggest a blank slate policy would take root when he arrived at Lord's. Graves hinted that a prolific run in county cricket could see him reinstated, which led to the 34-year-old extricating himself from his Indian Premier League contract and re-signing with Surrey. Downton's exit removed one significant obstacle and should Vaughan be handed the new position, that would strengthen his hand yet further. Former director of England Cricket, Paul Downton, was sacked after the nation's dismal World Cup. Another former England captain Alex Stewart has also put his hat into the ring for the vacancy. Surrey chief Alec Stewart, another former England captain who has indicated he would be open to talks with the ECB, is a confirmed Pietersen supporter - but another possible applicant, Andrew Strauss, is unlikely to be as effusive. Strauss' relations with Pietersen deteriorated badly in his final days as England captain, and an X-rated slip of the tongue during a commentary stint last summer suggested those wounds have not healed. There was no news from the board meeting on the future of national selector James Whitaker, who appeared vulnerable after Downton's dismissal. He looks set to continue in the role for the time being and is due to join the senior side in the West Indies for the second Test in Grenada and third in Barbados.", "summary": "Former England captain Michael Vaughan is favourite to replace Paul Downton as director of England cricket.

A milk price war is set to break out following a landmark decision by the EU to scrap quotas restricting production. The quota system was abolished today after 30 years - allowing dairy farmers to produce as much milk as they like without suffering a financial penalty. The move is expected to drive a spike in production, particularly in countries like Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands, who plan to boost exports of milk and other dairy products to the UK. As a result, a price war over the cost of milk is likely to break out, bringing down the price for consumers. However, British farmers are likely to find the price they are paid by supermarkets is driven down, which will be particularly difficult for smaller family businesses. Milk quotas were introduced in 1984 to address the oversupply during the late 1970s and early 1980s that had led to the infamous milk lakes and butter mountains. Farmers who produced above their quota were hit with punishing cash penalties. The new free-for-all will promote dairy factory farms, where super-size Holstein cows have been bred to produce more milk than any calf could drink in order to cut production costs. The industrialisation of dairy farming has seen the number of UK farms producing milk fall from 50,000 to 14,116 over the last 30 years. At the same time the average herd has risen from 64 cows to 134. The average milk production from Holstein dairy cows, which have been labelled \u2018udders on legs\u2019, has risen by 55per cent to 7,327 litres per animal per year \u2013 around 12,900 pints. In some cases this has been done through selective breeding programmes designed to create supersize cows, which are bulked up with high protein feed and kept inside for much of the year in what are known as \u2018zero grazing\u2019 barns. Dairy farmers have been under severe pressure in the past year as the result of a global glut in milk and a supermarket price war that drove down the price of a pint, making it cheaper than some bottled water. Some dairy processors have starting to raise farm gate prices recently, however farmers remain concerned the end of quotas could bring enormous price swings. Chairman of the dairy board at the National Farmers\u2019 Union, Rob Harrison, has urged all EU countries to act responsibly and collectively in order to manage future volatility. Mr Harrison said: \u2018Farmers and dairy processors here do have some concerns about how other EU countries will react to the ending of quotas. \u2018Some are rapidly increasing their output without an end market for these goods. With milk prices yet to show any strong signs of recovery, this could push farmgate milk prices down further in the EU, and stall any recovery in the dairy markets. \u2018It\u2019s vital that expansion in any Member State is planned in accordance with available market opportunities.\u2019 Dairy farmers have been under severe pressure in the past year as the result of a global glut in milk and a supermarket price war that drove down the price of a pint, making it cheaper than some bottled water. Mr Harrison said the new freedom could allow British dairy farmers, who are particularly efficient, to win new sales in Europe and around the world, particularly the Far East. He said: \u2018We also need UK dairy processors to recognise and promote potential markets both at home and abroad and look to develop new products such as sports drinks.\u2019 The idea of milk being promoted as a sports drink has been given credence by Coca-Cola, which has recently launched its own brand of milk in the United States. The new Fairlife milk costs more than twice as much as regular milk, but the firm believes consumers will pay more on the basis it contains 50per cent more protein and half the sugar. Earlier this week, some European farmer groups mounted a protest over the changes outside the European Parliament in Brussels, which involved a funeral march the lighting of a warning fire. The European Milk Board, a federation of dairy farmers with member organisations from 13 countries, said it was likely that the market would not be able to cope with significantly expanded production in a reasonable way. Its president, Romuald Schaber, said the changes are a particular threat to small dairy farmers, who tend to have higher costs. \u2018Chronic price collapses are inevitable, the next crisis is on its way,\u2019 he said. \u2018Prices will be rock-bottom, as Europe\u2019s farmers will have even less market power to achieve a cost-covering milk price in the future.\u2019 Maria Heubuch, an MEP for the Greens, warned about the loss of small farmers. \u2018Europe could see more factory farms with 1,000, 2,000 or even 5,000 cows, merely providing raw materials for the industry,\u2019 she said. The European Dairy Association, which represents milk processors, has backed the end of quotas. Its Secretary General, Alexander Anton, said: \u2018It goes without saying that the end of the quota will lower the administrative burden on all levels. This will naturally further enhance the competitiveness of the whole sector.\u2019 Irish dairy farmers have embarked on a massive expansion plan and will be looking to make big in-roads to the British market. A study by the Irish Farmers Association (IFA) estimated the ending of quotas would create 9,500 extra jobs in Ireland, and at least 1.3 billion euros (\u00a3950m) in extra exports. While productions restrictions have been scrapped, the EU will provide a safety net for dairy farmers. Brussels will have the power to buy-in butter and skimmed milk powder at a guaranteed figure if there is over-supply, which will shore up the price.", "summary": "Quota system abolished so farmers can produce as much milk as they like.

Andy Silvester, campaign director, said: 'Everyone should play by the rules, and that means paying back on time if HMRC say so. 'However, the real moral of this story is that we desperately need to simplify the tax code to get rid of the loopholes that those with clever accountants can drive a Take That tour bus through. 'Politicians make an awful lot of noise about tax evasion and avoidance but are addressing the symptom rather than the cause.'

Repaid: Other well-known clients who used the Icebreaker 'investment' scheme include TV sports presenter Gabby Logan (pictured right). Unlike Gary Barlow (left), she has already repaid everything she owed. Prime Minister David Cameron used a Take That lyric during Prime Minister's Questions, directed at Barlow, where he said 'We want your money back for good' as part of a pledge to get tax avoiders to return \u00a35billion. Money poured into Icebreaker, which used investment in the music industry to gain tax reliefs aimed at boosting the UK's creative industries, did not attract income tax. Icebreaker officials claimed that the initiative was funding music, supporting little-known artists to famous names such as Sinead O'Connor. But it was ruled by Judge Colin Bishopp that the scheme was mainly for tax avoidance rather than investments. Many of the 1,000 clients who invested in Icebreaker claimed they did not know the scheme broke any rules. David Cameron has previously used a Take That lyric during Prime Minister's Questions, directed at Barlow, where he said 'We want your money back for good' as part of a pledge to have \u00a35billion returned by tax avoiders.

Michelle, 27, who is getting set to tie the knot with fiance Mark Wright, shows off her summer tan and enviable curves posing by a pool in the new campaign imagery to promote the range, which lands today. The designer has been chanelling her passion for fashion into Lipsy ranges for several seasons now - and her success shows no sign of abating. The former Coronation Street star, whose collections have been a stellar success for the brand, has been hard at work in the design studio to bring fans exactly what they want for the warmer months. The actress and model shows off her natural beauty posing by the ocean in the summer shoot. The designer has been chanelling her passion for fashion into Lipsy ranges for several seasons now - and says she can't believe how successful they've been. The star, who says her ultimate beauty secrets are simply drinking lots of water and always taking her make-up off before bed, also swears by LVL eyelash 'flicking' treatments. Michelle Keegan teased fashion fans with some items from her new Lipsy range on Tuesday, and has unveiled her designs in full today. As the clothes horse shows, her new range is full of colourful print playsuits, cool crochet and lots of sophisticated lace. Speaking to FEMAIL recently, Michelle revealed the regime that keeps her fit, healthy and glowing from the inside out. Sharing her top tanning tips for a flawless faux glow as she shows off her natural beauty in behind the scenes imagery, Michelle advised: 'Always exfoliate first and not just knees and elbows, all over your body. 'Next, I moisturise all over and then use Garnier Dry Body Mist all over my body, including the underside of my arms.' The star, who says her ultimate beauty secrets are simply drinking lots of water and always taking her make-up off before bed, also swears by LVL eyelash treatments. LVL, which stands for length, volume and lift, flicks, curls and straightens lashes from the roots up so they appear much longer. 'It helps make my lashes darker and more voluminous,' says Michelle of the treatment, which takes an hour and a half and lasts over two months. Michelle, 27,\u00a0has been hard at work in the design studio to bring fans exactly what they want for the warmer months to come. The designer's success shows no sign of abating as she unveils yet another stylish range. The star also spoke about how important looking good was to her and how she takes a 'less is more' approach to make-up. Her beauty regime is fairly minimal and she simply cleanses, tones and moisturises every day and treats herself to a facial every other week to rehydrate her skin. She swears by Simple face wipes, Origins serums and Garnier and Kiehl's moisturisers. In terms of her diet, Michelle starts the day with scrambled egg on brown toast with tomato, followed by a high protein banana smoothie with peanut butter. For lunch, she has a turkey or chicken salad sandwich on brown bread and dinner is salad with chicken or prawn. The actress likes to snack on fruit, nuts and her favourite treat: popcorn. The star, 27, seen in her Garnier Ambre Solaire campaign, says she's always been a fan of the range and has been using it for years so when they asked her to work with them, she was 'over the moon' Bodywise, Michelle says she tries to work out as much as possible and whilst there's 'always an excuse not to go', she ends up feeling better after a workout. 'I've been very busy at the moment but if I have time, I go to the gym 3-4 times per week.' She doesn't, however, do any cardio and simply sticks to weight training to tone up. 'Cardio is good for getting you sweating but it slims you down and I think it makes me look too skinny,' she admitted. She also swears by the 8-minute abs YouTube video, which she does when she gets home from the gym. As for the future, Michelle says she 'may consider' doing an accessories and jewellery range but for now, she's focussing on her acting duties. 'I start filming next week for new movie,' she revealed. 'I am also in talks for another film, so fingers crossed it will go well.'", "summary": "Michelle unveils full Lipsy summer range.

The England winger instead pointed to his desire to finish out the season before considering any more offers, focusing on winning trophies with his club for the time being. But how much of what Sterling told BBC Sport can we believe? Sportsmail's Riath Al-Samarrai tries his hand at interpreting. Liverpool star Raheem Sterling gave a revealing insight into his Liverpool talks with BBC Sport. WHAT HE SAID: \u2018I would never want the fans to think bad of me, to think I just want as much money for myself. I want them to understand it\u2019s been a bit much for me this season, with everyone talking about it every minute.\u2019 WHAT HE MEANT:\u00a0Can\u2019t a guy just let his contract run down in peace? WHAT HE SAID: \u2018It\u2019s never been about money. I talk about winning trophies throughout my career. That\u2019s all I talk about.\u2019 WHAT HE MEANT:\u00a0 Finishing the season empty-handed won\u2019t help the situation. Sterling says it is not about money, only about trophies - so can Liverpool afford to not win any this season? WHAT HE SAID: \u2018I don\u2019t talk about how many cars I\u2019m going to drive, how many houses I\u2019ve got. I just purely want to be the best I can be.\u2019 WHAT HE MEANT:\u00a0If you\u2019re wondering, I drive a Mercedes C63 and also have a Range Rover 4x4. They are both white. WHAT HE SAID: \u2018You really want to be working with world-class players day in, day out. It\u2019s obviously left a little dent, these two world-class superstars (Suarez and Gerrard) leaving, but I think we have good players coming through at Liverpool.\u2019 WHAT HE MEANT::Players come and go. Deal with it. Sterling rejected Liverpool's contract offer of \u00a3100,000-a-week and says he is focusing on his football. WHAT HE SAID: On speculation that Arsenal are keen: \u2018Quite flattering.\u2019 WHAT HE MEANT:\u00a0 Auctions are always better when more people turn up. WHAT HE SAID: \u2018Everyone\u2019s dream growing up is seeing themselves in an away kit somewhere in a sunny country. But, in reality, I\u2019m happy to be playing for Liverpool and trying to win trophies.\u2019 WHAT HE MEANT:\u00a0 Barcelona and Madrid are nice cities. And warm, too. The 20-year-old England international has been linked with moves to Arsenal, Real Madrid and Barcelona. WHAT HE SAID: \u2018If, at that point in time, I was offered a contract, I most definitely would have signed straight away, probably for far less money than being said now. I just think the timing was a bit off.\u2019 WHAT HE MEANT:\u00a0 You need me more than ever now. WHAT HE SAID: \u2018I just want to focus on football and, when it gets to the end of the season, assess my position as a 20-year-old player playing in the Premier League.\u2019 WHAT HE MEANT:\u00a0 Literally all of the power in this situation is with me.

Most people will pick out a phantom-like picture of Albert Einstein. But if you see a Hollywood pin-up, you may need a trip to the opticians. At normal viewing distance, healthy eyes should be able to pick up the fine lines on Einstein's face, causing the brain to disregard Marilyn Monroe's image altogether. Scroll down for video. The image was created by superimposing a blurry picture of Monroe over a picture of Albert Einstein drawn in fine lines. Features with a high spatial frequency (Einstein) are only visible when you're viewing them close up, and those with low spatial frequencies (Monroe) are only visible from further away. Combining pictures of the two produces a single image which changes when the viewer moves closer or farther away from the screen. This classic optical illusion was created several years ago by neuroscientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In a recent video,\u00a0AsapScience highlighted the process behind the trick, which can also be seen in a still image by anyone if they move closer and then farther away from the screen. \u2018Depending on how well you\u2019re able to focus or pick up contrast your eye will only pick out details,\u2019 the video explains. \u2018Up close, we\u2019re generally able to pick up fine details like Einstein\u2019s moustache and wrinkles. \u2018But as the distance increases, or if your vision is poor and creates a more blurred image in the first place, your ability to pick up details fades away. \u2018Instead you only see general features, like the shape of mouth, nose and hair, and are left seeing Marilyn Monroe. \u2018. The MIT team, led by Dr Aude Oliva, has spent over a decade creating hybrid optical illusions that show how images can be hidden with textures, words and other objects. When you look at the image above, whose face do you see? At normal screen viewing distance you should see the face of Albert Einstein. Squint your eyes or take a few steps back from the image and Marilyn Monroe should come into view. 'Marilyn Einstein' was created by superimposing a blurry picture of Marilyn Monroe over a picture of Albert Einstein drawn in fine lines. Features with a high spatial frequency are only visible when viewing them close up, and those with low spatial frequencies are only visible at a distance. Combining pictures of the two produces a single image which changes when the viewer moves closer or farther away from the screen. Dr Oliva\u2019s group say these images not only reveal vision problems, but can also highlight how the brain processes information. In one study, participants were shown hybrid images for just of 30 milliseconds, and only recognised the low spatial resolution, or blurry, component of the image. On the top row, up close, you can see that the man on the left is scowling, while the woman on the right has a placid facial emotion. Move back, and the faces change expressions and even genders. If you squint, blink or defocus, the angry man turns calm, and the calm woman turns angry, and male. At normal viewing distance, you may see a dolphin. But disguised within the low spatial frequency of this hybrid is a car, which you will see once you step back a few metres. But when the images were shown for 150 milliseconds, they only recognised the image that was produced in fine detail, or in high spatial resolution. In a separate test, they were shown sad faces in high spatial resolution and angry faces in low spatial resolution. They superimposed pictures used both male and female faces. When displayed for 50 milliseconds, participants always saw an angry face, but were unable to pinpoint the sex of the person pictured. Dr Oliva says this shows that our brains discriminate between picking out fine detail in some situations, and broader detail in others. The brain\u2019s processing of fine details happens slightly later than processing other features, according to the research. The teams believes hybrid images such as this may prove useful to advertisers who want to change how their logos appear at different distances. It could also be used to mask text on devices so only someone viewing close up can read it. These images contain old fashioned maps of the distribution of cranial organs which can only be seen at close range to the image. At a distance, all that will be seen are two normal portraits. Hybrid images can create textures with viewing distance. This picture shows an example of a woman's face that turns into a cat at close distance.", "summary": "Look at the hybrid image at a normal viewing distance from the screen. If the image of Einstein doesn't appear, it may mean you have bad vision.

Ian Rogers, 36, became hooked on all things paranormal as a child and took part in his first ghost hunt in the year 2000. Since then he has spent hundreds of pounds on the creepy collection... and he's on the hunt for more to add. Scroll down for video. Ian Rogers owns nine haunted dolls all of which he says contain their own personality. Ian's favourite doll is Annabel, who he thinks is haunted by a seven-year-old girl who drowned. Ian, who is single, and a vehicle image inspector, from Leicester, says that his obsession with the supernatural began at a very young age. 'It started when I was a kid and I was looking into the Loch Ness Monster and ghosts. 'I went on a couple of ghost walks and then went on a hunt. It got me hooked.' The \u00a350 haunted dolls, which Ian gets from Jayne Harris, a professional in paranormal activity, are\u00a0said to contain the spirits of people who have passed on. Jayne keeps the dolls for around six months to get an idea of their personalities before selling them on. Ian says that he always goes to Jayne for the dolls because that way he can be sure of their authenticity. 'I know that I can trust her,' he says. 'If I bought them from eBay then there's no guarantee that they're actually haunted and I could just be being ripped off. 'Jayne is able to give me a bit of background about the dolls but I enjoy learning about them myself. Ian, who is single, became interested in the supernatural as a child and now is hooked on haunted dolls. Ian will often take his dolls to events and get people to guess their back stories.

Ian used to share his collection with his sister but she found the dolls too mischievous. Ian is pictured with the puppet, little is known about him other than he likes jazz and may be from Belgium. Although he is fond of his whole collection Ian definitely has a favourite: Annabel, a doll who he believes is haunted by the spirit of a seven-year-old girl who drowned while playing with her brother. Ian says that each of his dolls has their own story and he often asks others to try and figure out what might have happened to them. Ian said: 'I take the dolls with me to events that I host and get people to guess their stories. 'If someone guesses three things that we already know correctly then they get some money off. 'One lady said she could sense an 'Annie' so I went to get Annabel. She said she'd died and felt trapped. 'As soon as she picked up the doll she said she felt soaking wet, and that she knew Annabel had drowned.' Ian holds sessions with the dolls where guests interested in the paranormal can undertake a variety of activities. Ian also holds sessions with his dolls where guests can undertake different paranormal experiences. Pictured: Simon, who committed suicide after the death of his own mother. Ian avoids buying his dolls on eBay as he says there is no guarantee that they would be haunted. Pictured: Harriet who is said to be a 17-year-old girl who is angry, but not vicious and committed suicide. The dolls were previously shared between Ian and his sister, but his sister wanted to get rid of them after they started causing her too much mischief, for example hiding her keys. However Ian says that he hasn't been put off in the slightest and is even looking at investing in other supernatural souvenirs. 'I would love to get more haunted dolls, and I'm looking into other items. I would love to get a haunted mirror.' Ian hopes his next paranormal purchase will be a haunted mirror.

And then Parkhead manager said the striker\u2019s desire to prove him wrong should serve as an example to any player left out of his starting XI. Griffiths took just 19 minutes to score a treble that takes Celtic ever closer to a clean sweep of domestic honours, staking an obvious claim to start in Sunday\u2019s Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness at Hampden. Deila, asked if he thought the forward was trying to prove a point, said: \u2018It looks like that - and that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to do it. That\u2019s what I expect from the other subs as well. You can be angry but the way to get back into the team is to prove you deserve to play - like Leigh did today. Ronny Deila celebrates after Celtic came from behind to beat Kilmarnock at Parkhead on Wednesday. \u2018He was fabulous. You can\u2019t do any better than three goals. His contribution was excellent. And his left foot? He could be a kicker in American football \u2013 he\u2019d be very good, I think. \u2018He\u2019s improved a lot in my time here. He\u2019s training well and as a 24-hour athlete he\u2019s been getting better and better, even though he eats cakes on the bench sometimes. But it\u2019s just a start \u2013 he needs to keep working on small things and he\u2019ll get even more goals. \u2018He and John Guidetti played well together today and that\u2019s something to think about when we play with two strikers.\u2019 Asked if Griffiths is now a certain starter for Sunday, Deila said: \u2018He played very well today so we\u2019ll see.\u2019 Deila shakes hands with Leigh Griffiths, who collects the match ball after his hat-trick. Celtic came back from the loss of a goal early in the second half to crush Killie, Deila saying: \u2018Defensively we were very good for the first 60 minutes, we had the ball all the time and they didn\u2019t have a shot on target. \u2018Our attacking play was too slow, too many square passes and we didn\u2019t create anything. We said at the break we needed to take more risk and get behind them. With Leigh coming on we had a lot more movement and we opened them up and got our goals.\u2019 Celtic could now win the title against closest rivals Aberdeen on May 10 \u2013 if both teams win all their games beforehand. But Deila hopes his team won\u2019t even need to beat the Dons in their own back yard to be crowned champions. Griffiths completes his hat-trick against\u00a0Kilmarnock on Wednesday at Parkhead to move eight points clear. Wednesday\u2019s win took Celtic eight points clear with six games remaining. Should both teams win their remaining league games, an away win at Pittodrie would finish the race. Yet Deila said: \u2018We could win it before Pittodrie. Hopefully we will. It\u2019s possible \u2013 if they lose a game and we win we can do that. \u2018We want to win the title as early as possible and today was a very important win and we\u2019re in to a very important week. If you can get into the last five games eight points ahead we have a very good chance. \u2018. The Parkhead side have two Friday night fixtures against Dundee and St Johnstone \u2013 and won\u2019t play another game on Saturday at 3pm this season. Substitute Griffiths came off the bench to spark Celtic into life after lacklustre first-half. If Celtic wrap up the league flag they will be presented with the trophy before their final home game against Inverness Caledonian Thistle on May 24, the final day of the season. Aberdeen will play St Johnstone in their final game, with the top six completed by a Dundee derby. The final round of bottom six ties could be held on the night of Friday, May 22. The team which finishes 11th will be consigned to a two-leg play-off against the winners of the Championship play-off. With St Mirren 10 points adrift at the foot of the table with just 15 points left to play for, Motherwell will begin their quest to leapfrog Ross County out of the play-off spot with a local Friday night derby against Hamilton.

The idea of having another referendum on Scotland's future in the UK before 2020 was ranked 19th on a list of 23 policies presented to voters. It comes after Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon last night refused to rule out staging a second independence vote if the SNP wins the 2016 Holyrood elections. Scroll down for video. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was campaigning in Aberdeen today ahead of a second TV debate tonight. When questioned on the issue in last night's Scottish leaders TV debate, Ms Sturgeon insisted an SNP victory in the General Election would not trigger another referendum. But she added it was 'another matter' whether a vote for her party in the 2016 Holyrood elections would bring about a second vote on independence. Ms Sturgeon has also vehemently criticised David Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe. But a poll by Ipsos Mori for BBC Scotland reveals that a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union was more popular with voters north of the border than another independence ballot. More than 1,000 adults were questioned for the research, with pollsters asking them to give various issues a score of between one and 10, depending on how important these were to them. A score of one meant a policy should not be implemented while 10 was taken to mean it should be put into action immediately. In last night's TV showdown with the Scottish leaders of Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems, Mr Sturgeon refused to rule out a second independence vote before 2020. Ms Sturgeon has\u00a0 vehemently criticised David Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe. The most popular policy was increasing the minimum wage for those aged over 21, which was given a score of 8.2.

Holding another independence referendum by 2020 was given a score of 5.6, compared to 6.1 for a referendum on remaining in the EU. Scottish National Party election campaign director Angus Robertson insisted the poll showed support for his party's main policies. He said: 'This is a very welcome poll - it demonstrates that the people of Scotland share our view that the Westminster parties are not delivering on their referendum vow, and want far more power for Scotland. 'Electing a strong team of SNP MPs in May is the only way to ensure that Scotland gets the power we need to build social justice and economic prosperity.' Scotland's political leaders, from left to right, Tory Ruth Davidson, Labour's Jim Murphy, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat Willie Rennie faced off in a live TV election debate last night. Overall, Scots prefer more public spending ahead of paying off the deficit \u2013 but also favour the Government's welfare cap. However, there is also widespread support for a Mansion Tax and an increase in the top rate of income tax to 50p. Mark Diffley, Director, Ipsos MORI Scotland said: 'The poll gives a clear steer about where the economic priorities for voters in Scotland lie. 'Broadly, Scots want to see measures to improve the standard of living, particularly a higher minimum wage, rises in pensions and lower energy bills.

A British father who vanished during a stag do in Barcelona was forced to walk for 20 hours after his taxi driver dumped him outside the Spanish city - and told him to find his own way home. Marc Carn, from Plymouth, Devon, was drinking in an Irish bar with ten friends near to Las Ramblas on Saturday night when he suddenly disappeared. After he failed to turn up for his flight back home, Mr Carn's worried family contacted the Foreign Office in a bid to track him down. They said his disappearance was completely out of character and feared he would miss the first birthday of his twins Freddie and Stanley. But the phoneless 29-year-old today handed himself into the British Consulate - having walked for two days to try and get back to Barcelona. According to his family, Mr Carn, who runs his own building company, was dropped 'miles away' from his accommodation by the Spanish driver when he tried to get back to his hotel on Saturday night. He then set off to try and find his friends - and only arrived at the British Consulate this afternoon. Speaking after he was found, Anna Harvey, the sister of Mr Carn's 31-year-old partner Emma, said the family was 'ecstatic' that he was safe. She said: 'He got into a taxi and the driver took him miles away from where he was staying. 'When he said at the end of the journey this was not his accommodation he was chucked out of the cab and has spent the last two days walking back to Barcelona. He has just walked in to the British Consulate to say he was stranded.' She added that the family were not yet sure where he had been stranded but that it was 'miles' away from where he was staying. She said: 'He has been walking for about 20 hours. The message we had from him was quite garbled so at the moment we are not sure exactly where he was dumped, but it appears it was a very long way from where he should have been. 'He was stranded with no phone or money. My sister is so relieved and the family are ecstatic. None of us thought we would ever see him again. The father-of-four, pictured left and right with partner Emma Harvey, had last been seen by friends on Saturday night and failed to turn up for his flight back home from the Spanish city. Family and friends became concerned after not hearing from Mr Carn for more than 48 hours. They contacted the Foreign Office amid fears that he would miss the first birthday of his twins Stanley and Freddie (pictured) 'His friends are buying him a flight home tonight so he can be back in time for his twins boys' first birthday tomorrow.'

The illegal animal traders had kept the terrified three-year-old in the box for two weeks. And the men had been trying to find a buyer on the lucrative black market\u00a0when they were stopped at a check point\u00a0trying to cross into Sierra Leone from Guinea, in west Africa, last week. Scroll down for video. This orphaned chimp was found cowering in a tiny box terrified of the animal traffickers who killed her mother. The traffickers were caught during a joint operation by the Guinea Ministry of Environment, the Gendarmerie and the Guin\u00e9e-Application de la Loi Faunique (GALF) project. Charlotte Houpline, director of French wildlife protection group WARA, said\u00a0many traffickers have already been arrested and sentenced in Guinea sine they launched the project. She said: 'Slowly the change that is needed is happening. We have been supporting the Government of Guinea for four years now to strengthen law enforcement. Facilitating the arrest and conviction of wildlife traffickers is the main part of our work. 'And we want to target mainly the major traffickers to tackle head-on its major obstacle - corruption.' She added that Guinea, as well as all the other African countries home to great apes, have a low rate of prosecution for animal trafficking. The traffickers, who kept the three-year-old alive with food (pictured) had been trying to find a buyer for her. A spokeswoman for Eco Activists for Governance and Law Enforcement, said: 'The three-year old female who was saved last Saturday was the lucky one. 'She could very easily have ended in the house of some wealthy foreigner or even in an official zoo, travelling out of the country with false documents. 'But even more probably she might not even survive, as the estimations are that for one young ape, smuggled out of Africa, 10 others die on the way, as the traffickers are not able to provide them with proper care. 'Other horrific numbers are unknown - the babies, which are detected and in best case seized, like this our one, present only a minority of all poached and sold ape babies. 'By easy calculation, we can estimate the number of chimpanzees lost only in Guinea during last years to reach tens of thousands. The illegal animal traders had kept the terrified three-year-old chimpanzee in the box for two weeks. 'And hundreds of thousands in the all sub-Saharan Africa. This crime will drive the chimpanzees in wild to the extinction within few decades, if it is not stopped. 'Little apes are like human children. To survive, they need not only food, they need love and care. Trauma, which they experience when they see their mother and their family being killed, is not easy to forget. 'When their family is attacked and mother killed, they cannot do anything else than cling to her. And then they are torn away from mother\u00b4s still warm body by the same men who killed her, falling easily into depression and deprivation. 'Yet the future of this particular female looks brighter. She was not seriously injured nor fatally traumatised. Immediately after rescue she was accepted by a sanctuary that takes care of orphaned chimpanzees who survived the slaughter of their families. 'There she has a second chance, starting with a long process of rehabilitation to overcome the traumas they suffered and hoping to one day be back to the wild.' Chimpanzees are the closest genetic living relatives to humans - and their young take years to mature. They were stopped at a check point trying to cross into Sierra Leone from Guinea, in West Africa, last week. The country is a hub of wildlife trafficking internationally where apes, ivory, skins, reptiles, parrots, shark fins and manatees are illegally exported by organised crime syndicates. Since 2007, more than 130 chimpanzees and 10 gorillas were exported from Guinea to China with valid CITES permits, which classified these animals as having been bred in captivity - despite no captive breeding programmes existing in Guinea. According to UN Great Apes Survival Partnership (GRASP) the poachers have to kill approximately 10 chimpanzees to get one baby. So for 130 chimps, exported out of the country, 1,300 of their family members were slaughtered.. One year ago GALF, the Guinea Conakry branch of WARA provided information which lead to the arrest of one of the most notorious ape traffickers in Guinea, Ousmane Diallo. He was sentenced to a year in prison in July 2013 following an 18 month meticulous investigation by GALF.

Researchers in Massachusetts believe a person's keystrokes may reveal a huge amount of information about their motor skills. Now they're working on creating a keyboard that can tell doctors if someone has the neuron impairment, simply by analysing the way they type. Scroll down for video. Scientists claim the common computer keyboard could be a powerful new tool in their battle against Parkinson's disease. Researchers in Massachusetts say a person's keystrokes may reveal a huge amount of information about their motor skills. For the body to begin moving, the brain's primary motor cortex sends signals through several other brain regions, including the supplementary motor area, cerebellum, and basal ganglia. These brain areas activate spinal neurons that stimulate muscles to execute the movement. But many factors can interfere with motor ability, including sleep deprivation, which reduces dexterity. In people with Parkinson's disease, dopamine-producing cells in part of the brain called the substantia nigra are killed off, leading to tremors, slowness of movement, and difficulty walking. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have now created an algorithm that can tell how effectively someone is striking a keypad. For instance, it can distinguish between typing done in the middle of the night, when sleep deprivation impairs motor skills, and typing performed when fully rested. It does this by analysing something known as 'key hold time' - a measure of how long a key is pressed before being released. The study is based on the premise that 'there might be hidden information in the way that we type,' says Ian Butterworth, one of researchers. 'At the moment, pretty much all of the other information in typing is thrown out. We just pay attention to what keys are being pressed, not when or for how long.' Scientists have developed a six-minute test which could give an early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Currently Parkinson's patients only discover they have the debilitating neurological problem when the symptoms have already taken hold. But last year Oxford University academics have come up with a new way of spotting the disease at an early stage. The researchers were able to detect early Parkinson's disease with a remarkable 85 per cent accuracy. The technique uses an MRI scanner to monitor the neural connections in a concentrated area at the very centre of the brain. Even at a very early stage, Parkinson's patients had much weaker connections in the basal ganglia region of the brain, which is associated with motor control. The study, which has been published in the journal Neurology, found that by taking 180 pictures in six minutes they could spot the poor connections. They also found that the test had a very low chance of incorrectly diagnosing healthy people with the disease. This study focused on the effects of fatigue, but the researchers say they could diagnose conditions that impair motor function, such as Parkinson's disease, much earlier than is now possible. Preliminary results from a study of about two dozen Parkinson's patients suggest that the researchers' algorithm for analysing keystrokes can also distinguish people who have the disease from those who don't. The team is now planning a larger study of Parkinson's patients. They are also working on smartphone apps that could be used to gather the same kind of data from mobile devices. 'We thought this was a unique opportunity to have a window into the brain using your normal interactions with an electronic device,' says MIT researcher Alvaro Sanchez-Ferro. 'You already have the hardware. You just have to let someone evaluate the information you collect every day when you use the device, and try to pull it out for health-related purposes.' People are usually diagnosed with Parkinson's disease five to 10 years after the beginning of the disease, and lot of the damage has already been done, the researchers say. John Growdon, director of the Memory and Movement Disorders Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, says it will be important for the researchers to demonstrate in future studies that the typing deficiencies correlate with the severity of Parkinson's disease. 'Overall, it strikes me that this has great potential to detect subtle motor impairments even in advance of a clinician's ability to find them,' adds Growdon, who was not involved in the study. The researchers believe this strategy could also be used to evaluate patients with other diseases that affect motor skills, such as rheumatoid arthritis. 'This might have applications in any disease producing a motor impairment, whether it's in your hands and muscles or the brain,' Sanchez-Ferro says. The team are working on smartphone apps that may be used to gather the same type of data from mobiles.", "summary": "MIT's algorithm reveals how effectively someone is striking keys.

She told the court: 'What he said was \"don't worry, I will take care of her, I hope she is as sweet as she looks\".' But when she asked Mee to repeat what he has said she explained how he went quiet and then hung up. Lisa Wilding QC, for Mee, then asked the witness: 'In light of what she had told you about her concerns about him wanting a relationship, if that was said it must have made you quite concerned?' Mee, formerly of south London, but who now lives in Scotland, has denied all the charges against him. She replied: 'Obviously... it came across as inappropriate to me and the meaning I get from that was it had some sexual undertones.' The witness also claimed that during the phone call, Mee told her 'I will give it to her hard or rough.' Ms Wilding then asked: 'The man you have concerns about has just told you he is going to have rough sex with your cousin, what did you do about that?'

He has picked his agent friends well, worked the loophole in the system \u2013 one Fifa want to close allowing third party ownership in Spain when it is banned in other leagues - and that has played a part in the club's rise. Mendes it was who discovered Costa and brought him to Atletico Madrid via Portugal. The super-agent can also claim to have been the man who saw the huge potential in the unrefined Brazilian front man, overruling scouts that he usually trusted without question and signing the youngster from Lagarto thus beginning the process of making him one of Europe\u2019s top striker. He was loaned him out to four La Liga clubs but was always brought back to Atletico who would eventually win the Spanish Cup, the European Super Cup and the League with him as their centre-forward. Koke is Atletico's brightest homegrown talent and he lined up in midfield on Tuesday night. Mario Suarez and Gabi try to stop Cristiano Ronaldo during the Madrid derby in the Champions League. As well as using the right agents to get the right players Atletico have \u2013 like so many teams in Spain benefitted from an extensive and well-run youth system. Koke is their brightest homegrown talent and he lined up in midfield on Tuesday against Real Madrid with Mario Suarez and Gabi who also both came through the ranks at Atletico albeit only arriving at the first team after long spells away from the club. Next season Oliver Torres should return from a hugely successful spell at Porto and line up alongside another off the conveyor build: the hugely impressive Saul Niguez. It also shouldn\u2019t be forgotten that with a very similar squad back in 2012 Atletico Madrid were closer to the relegation places than the European places and even their most blinkered fan would have dismissed out of hand the idea that they would ever be winning the league and playing the Champions League final in the same season any time soon. The reason for the change is perhaps their greatest signing of all \u2013 Diego Simeone. He arrived at the start of 2012 just after they had been knocked out of Copa del Rey by a third division side. The likes of former Osasuna winger Juanfran were in the team back then too \u2013 he looked a symbol of the oh-so average signings being made by the club at the time. Simeone has been up there with their greatest signings when they made him manager previously. Juanfran was converted by Simeone to full-back and is now in the form of his life at Atletico. Juanfran was converted by Simeone to full-back and is now first choice on the right hand side of Spain\u2019s defence. His transformation is still a symbol, only now it is one of just how much the club and team have progressed. Chinese company Wanda now owns 20 per cent of Atletico Madrid, their tax debt is under control and they are in a position to sign players without having to sell. Having bought so well when they were in a worse financial situation, supporters are optimistic \u2013 just as long as they don\u2019t lose Simeone: the real alchemist at Atletico Madrid.", "summary": "Atletico Madrid 0-0 Real Madrid: Click here for Martin Samuel's report.

Landlord Richard Stevenson, 32, had mascot Ollie the Owl snatched from the lounge area of the Admiral Rodney, in Nottingham, last month. He thought the \u00a37.99 ornament had been lost forever until he received a letter in the post on March 6 demanding a donation to charity for its safe return. Those responsible for the theft even created a Facebook page to keep fans updated about Ollie's adventures since being snatched. The owl has been pictured sunning itself on a beach after it was 'kidnapped' from a Nottingham pub. The wooden ornament even took a trip on the back of a camel on its travels. Incredibly, the wooden statue has already jetted off to Belfast, Benidorm and even Tunisia despite only going missing a month ago. Pictures posted on the 'Oliver Howel' Facebook page show Ollie sunbathing on a beach towel with an iPod and even taking a ride on the back of a camel. He can also be seen perched on a wall overlooking a beach in Benidorm and is seen sitting on a bar next to pint of Guinness in Belfast. After boarding a plane from the Spanish holiday resort, Ollie teased his owners with a status update saying: 'Hi I'm off again another plane journey.. This one is going to be hot, keep checking in to see where I am.' Today, landlord Richard, who runs the pub with partner Christy Jamieson, 28, said: 'We are missing Ollie but it's been amazing where he's been. The \u00a37.99 model perches on a stone rail high above a beach in Benidorm. The journey began in Nottingham, pictured here at the National Ice Centre in the city. 'He's had three holidays already and he's only been gone for a month. 'I did have a few clues to who had taken him but they found out and apparently passed Ollie on to someone else. 'We also received a card from a child though the post with a donation of \u00a31 which has gone to the air ambulance.' Pub regular John Wiles, 45, added: 'I can't believe he has got as far as Tunisia. He will need his wings clipping.' The wooden statue is enjoying some sunnier climes than the usual shelf in Nottingham. The owl has had three holidays in less than a month since he was stolen from a pub shelf. Ollie's kidnappers have also taken the owl to more local locations with pictures of him joining a stag party in a city centre bar and visiting Nottingham Castle. He also posted a picture to his 138 Facebook friends perched on the city's famous Robin Hood statue as well as another image showing him at an ice hockey game. The bird has also popped in to Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem - reputed to be the oldest pub in England. Landlord Richard Stevenson and landlady Christy Jamieson of the Admiral Rodney in Nottingham with ransom letters sent to the pub following the 'kidnapping' of their owl ornament. It's thirsty work for the owl as it continues to travel around the world; pictured here at a Belfast bar. The owl has managed to take in some sights of Belfast, visiting the historic places in the Northern Irish capital. Landlord Richard bought Ollie from homeware store The Range 18 months ago when the couple took over the pub. The three-inch ornament is part of a set of three that had sat on a shelf in the pub lounge. In the ransom letter posted to the pub shortly after Ollie went missing, the kidnappers said the bird will be back in time for a charity festival on the August Bank Holiday weekend. The jovial note, which arrived in a brown envelope with a Nottingham postal stamp, stated: 'I have been taken against my will...kidnapped. The visit to Belfast also brings the opportunity for the owl to read up some history of the city. The owl took the opportunity of freedom to pose for a photo with Nottingham's most famous resident - Robin Hood. 'I was frightened at first but I really like the people who have taken me from your top shelf. 'I am going to be away for a while, and I am going to travel to lots of different places in England and abroad. 'I've been sitting on your shelf for too long... so I am going to find a girlfriend.' The owl could escape the queues for the Belfast boat tours by flying in, surely... Richard, who lives above the pub, added: 'It's a little bit crazy and just a bit weird how it all came about. 'I absolutely wet myself laughing, especially when I got a friend request on Facebook. 'We've seen a picture of a pink owl, which must be his new girlfriend. I suppose I'm a bit jealous of his travelling, and the regulars think it's hilarious.'

And they are struggling in the aftermath. Anuradha Koirala, who rescues victims of sex trafficking, has a rehabilitation center in Kathmandu that is home to 425 young women and girls. While her primary facility seems structurally unharmed, all of the children have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks, followed by a second earthquake on May 12. The once-vibrant campus has gone from a place of safety and healing to one of uncertainty and worry. \"We are suffering with rain, strong wind. The fear is not gone from us. It is very, very hard,\" said Koirala, the founder of the nonprofit Maiti Nepal and the 2010 CNN Hero of the Year. The public has been warned not to use the main water line due to risk of cholera. Koirala's group is relying on bottled water and is now rationing food. Still, she has offered to take in 200 other girls orphaned by the disaster. \"These girls are most vulnerable, because now people will target them,\" Koirala said. \"They could be victims of any forms of sexual abuse. Maybe rape, maybe they will be trafficked, anything.... If I get more support I will take as many as I can.\" About five miles away, the wall of Koirala's HIV/AIDS hospice has crumbled. Home to 115 girls, many of whom are terminally ill, the facility is under guard. \"They're not injured, but they are terrified,\" Koirala said. \"Everything is broken in the hospice.\" Koirala's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district, and all of them have been damaged. \"It's really very sad for me and for my children,\" Koirala said. \"This disaster, the noise and the way it shook, I cannot get over it. I was not afraid that I was going to be killed. I was afraid about what is going to happen next.\" Another CNN Hero, Pushpa Basnet, and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence. They are now living on the ground in a nearby field. \"Physically, we are not hurt. But mentally, we are,\" said Basnet, whose Early Childhood Development Center provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated. Basnet says the building's walls are all cracked, and the staff is afraid it might fall down. She and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse, taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves. \"It's really cold in the middle of the night; there are lots of fox in the field,\" Basnet said. \"We are really scared.\" They also don't have much water or food, Basnet says. But she is trying to stay positive. \"I think for the time being, whatever we have, we should be happy, you know? Because at least we have our life,\" she said. \"(My kids) all are safe. That's the most important thing for me.\" Basnet's \"Butterfly Home\" -- the permanent residence she was building for the children -- also suffered extensive damage in the quake. Basnet had hoped to complete construction in the next six months, with the opening ceremony set for October. Basnet purchased the land for the home with prize money she received as the 2012 Hero of the Year. \"When the earthquake hit that land, all my dreams were scattered,\" she said. \"I have to restart again.\" Still, Basnet is quick to point out that so many other survivors have nothing and are desperately in need of aid. To that end, several CNN Heroes have been assisting in relief efforts in Nepal. Jake Wood's disaster relief organization, Team Rubicon, has a team of experienced veterans and first responders on the ground in Kathmandu. The group deployed a medical and assessment team to aid the Nepalese people in several remote villages outside of the city. Six canine-firefighter search teams from the United States also assisted in rescue and recovery efforts. The teams were trained by Wilma Melville's National Disaster Search Dog Foundation and were deployed as part of a larger rescue force that includes structural engineers, hazmat experts and doctors. Tom Henderson's ShelterBox, which provides emergency shelter and lifesaving supplies, has so far committed to help more than 15,000 families. Dr. Laura Stachel's group, We Care Solar, sent solar suitcases to health care workers, providing them with light and power as they aid survivors. Arlene Samen's group, One Heart World-Wide, has set up tented birthing centers where pregnant women can safely deliver their babies, especially in hard-hit districts. Robin Lim, a disaster response midwife who founded Bumi Sehat, joined Samen in Kathmandu to help the mothers. Doc Hendley's nonprofit, Wine to Water, partnered with Appalachian State University in order to distribute 1,000 water filters where they are most needed in Nepal. The group says one filter can provide water for up to 10 people and last for up to 10 years if maintained properly.", "summary": "Anuradha Koirala and 425 young women and girls have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks.

The 18-year-old had made just four substitute appearances before facing the Sons at the Dumbarton Stadium, but his double put Rangers in command after they fell behind to Mark Wilson's second-minute opener. The former Celtic full-back's last goal was also against Rangers - he netted the Hoops' winner in a controversial Scottish Cup quarter-final replay at Parkhead in March 2011. Rangers' teenage striker Ryan Hardie scored a brace on his full debut against Dumbarton on Saturday. Hardie's brace comes as Rangers boss Stuart McCall fulfills his promise of fielding more academy players. A touchline bust-up between then Celtic boss Neil Lennon and Gers assistant Ally McCoist sparked a summit on sectarianism but there was no further drama this time as Haris Vuckic fired home a spectacular third and Rangers eased to victory. McCall promised his students from the Murray Park youth ranks they would be given their chance to impress when he took over last month. And he stayed good to his word as Hardie - who has notched more than 30 times for the club's under-20s side - and winger Tom Walsh came in to replace Kenny Miller and Dean Shiels following Wednesday's 1-1 slip-up at Livingston. But Nicky Clark's horror miss after less than a minute was not the start the Ibrox boss was looking for, especially when Wilson showed the Gers striker how it should have been done 60 seconds later. Darren McGregor should have cleared Mark Gilhaney's cross but got caught underneath the ball and could only head it straight to the ex-Hoops defender. The 30-year-old averages just a goal a season but showed no hesitancy as he flashed a left-footed strike past Cammy Bell to give the Sons a shock lead. Lee McCulloch thought he had the visitors level, only for home keeper Danny Rogers to produce a stunning reaction stop to keep out the skipper's volley. But Hardie did find the net after 10 minutes as he capped his full debut with a dream goal. Sons defender Andy Graham could not live with the teenager's pace as he latched on to Vuckic's through ball and raced in on goal. Rogers got a hand to the youngster's low shot but Hardie stayed alert and followed in to force the ball over the line before Stuart Findlay could block. Rogers did better with McGregor's powerful strike, but Rangers suffered another scare when Dylan Easton danced past McCulloch before lashing just wide of Bell's goal. Tom Walsh and Nicky Law fired over as McCall's team looked for the lead, but there was no breakthrough by the interval. But they only had to wait three minutes into the second period for Hardie to strike again. Rangers playmarker Haris Vuckic (right) has become a fan-favourite during his loan spell from Newcastle. McGregor took a high ball and hooked it wide to Wallace, whose cross flew towards the youngster at an awkward height. But, with his back to goal, he sent the ball over his own shoulder with a flick of his toe and watched it bounce past Rogers' dive into the bottom corner. Now in front, Rangers went for Dumbarton's throat and got their reward as Vuckic collected Law's short pass before whipping an unstoppable 25-yard shot into the top-left corner. The Sons, though, came up with a couple of reminders that they should not be discounted yet as Scott Taggert fired just over before on-loan Celtic defender Findlay leapt unmarked to head straight at Bell. Hardie, though, was looking to make his impressive start even more special and nearly grabbed himself a hat-trick as his attempted lob sailed just over Rogers' crossbar. But he was denied his treble when McCall afforded the frontman a standing ovation as he was replaced by Calum Gallacher with five minutes left. Rangers were not satisfied yet, though, and nearly had a fourth when Law shook the bar from the edge of the box, while Clark was not far away with an ambitious 40-yard volley.

Mohammad Liaqat even assaulted the headmaster during the rampage in which he hurled insults at white teachers in front of shocked parents as they picked up their children. The 34-year-old objected to the strict uniform policy at Mount Carmel High School which stated that pupils could not have beards. Liaqat launched into a 'racist tirade' at white members of staff after 14-year-old boys were told they could not keep their facial hair, police said. After being arrested, Liaqat was told to stay away from the school, so went to another school nearby where he continued his rant. When Jeff Brown, headmaster of St Oswald's Roman Catholic Primary School, asked him to move on, Liaqat shoulder barged him, Burnley Crown Court was told. He has a child at the secondary school in Accrington, Lancashire, but was not related to the two 14-year-olds who wanted to have facial hair for religious reasons. Liaqat launched his first outburst even though the situation involving the students\u2019 beards had already been resolved at Mount Carmel. During a three-day trial this week, Liaqat was found guilty of one count of assault and five counts of racially or religiously aggravated behaviour. He was remanded into custody at Burnley Crown Court and will be sentenced in June. Mount Carmel school said the ruling on beards was part of the school's dress code, but the 14-year-olds wanted to keep their facial hair for religious reasons. After being taught in isolation for breaking the school rules, Mount Carmel governors decided that the students could keep their beards so long as they signed up to a programme at their mosque to show their faith. After the trial, Xavier Bowers, headteacher at Mount Carmel said: 'We are pleased that justice has been done in this instance. 'My staff were simply doing their job at the time, supervising our children leaving school and making sure they were safe. 'Without provocation, they were verbally assaulted and abused in front of the children and parents. 'We always try to work towards good relationships with our families. This was an unfortunate incident, but we can now draw a line under it and move on. We are largely a happy school and we have good relationships with our local community.'

PC Dave Hall, from the hate crime and cohesion unit at Lancashire Police, said: 'Ultimately, the issue at Mount Carmel was amicably resolved, but Liaqat decided to take it upon himself to stage his own personal protest. 'He racially abused several of the school staff and he kept referring to Mount Carmel as a racist school. He went on a racist tirade towards the white members of staff. He made it quite clear he was deeply upset. 'After being arrested, he was released on bail. He decided to vent his fury at St Oswald's Primary. 'He had reason to be there but not to behave in the way he did. 'Liaqat was causing problems, which led to the headteacher asking him to leave the premises. He reacted by racially abusing staff there and assaulting the head. 'What he did was completely unacceptable. Whatever his motives, we cannot accept this kind of behaviour.'

Australian researchers have tested their drone running companion. Called Joggobot (shown) it is designed to float in front of jogger when they run. The technology could allow it to track the speed and direction of the runner. And it could be used for other sports like cycling and rowing. The research, by the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Australia, reported Popular Science,\u00a0was presented at the Computer-Human Interaction Conference in Seoul. In their\u00a0paper,\u00a0the researchers explained how they asked 13 joggers to run for an average of 26 minutes with a drone - specifically a quadcopter - as a companion. The goal was to see if a drone could motivate a runner to keep their pace up, and provide a companion that helped them stay fit. In this experiment, the quadcopters were programmed to follow a set path and speed, which the joggers also followed. The drone was designed to fly 13ft (four metres) in front of the jogger at a height of 10ft (three metres). Each participant was fitted with a Go Pro camera and, after finishing their run of between 15 and 40 minutes, gave their thoughts on having a robot companion. Most said that they found it was a good \u2018pace keeper\u2019, especially on straight sections of their run. Technology has been developed where a drone could lock onto a pattern on a runner\u2019s shirt in order to track their speed and direction, although this hasn't been implemented yet. However, the researchers said their\u2019s was \u2018the first system that has been successfully deployed in an outdoor setting.\u2019 \u2018It forces you to go a certain pace, pushes you a bit further,\u2019 said one runner. \u2018If I was running by myself, I think my pace would vary a bit more, this is a more set pace.' Ultimately, it seemed that the runners felt a sense of \u2018peer pressure\u2019 similar to how one might feel if they were running with a human companion. In this experiment, the quadcopters were programmed to follow a set path, which the joggers also followed. However, technology has been developed where a drone could lock onto a pattern on a runner\u2019s shirt in order to track their speed and direction (shown) There were some concerns from the runners, though; occasionally the quadcopter would deviate from its path, leading them to question their safety.

Some runners may have dogs as jogging companions now, but will be using robots in the future? The team hope their research could inspire new ways to perform such activities. In a cycling scenario, the researchers say the drone could create a draft, \u2018providing a psychological and maybe even physical boost.\u2019 Other drones could display encouraging messages to keep motivation high. \u2018Overall, our work aims to inspire other designers to utilise robotic systems to support exertion activities,\u2019 the researchers concluded.

Swindon\u2019s win over Peterborough meant Steve Cotterill will have to wait until Tuesday to finish the job of returning to the Championship, but almost as importantly they made sure Preston wouldn\u2019t make any ground on them in the top two. Three points at Bradford on Tuesday will do the trick - only that standing in their way now. It would take something to go seriously awry for the Robins not to be returning to the second tier after a two-year absence, and they did their job well enough to prevent any late scares in the north west. Bristol City striker Aaron Wilbraham celebrates his 63rd minute goal against Preston at Deepdale.

A six-minute rendition of \u2018F*** off Swindon Town, you are staying down\u2019 rang out of the gleeful away end at Deepdale - populated by 2,400 - as that return got ever closer. City had dispensed of their rivals on Tuesday night, hammering them 3-0, and took great delight in revelling in their triumph. It was an afternoon whereby neither side played with any nerves - there are reasons why these two occupy the automatic promotion places - although lacking a fluidity you would perhaps expect. There was an illusion of this being an open game, but the two five-man midfields shattered that. Jermaine Beckford came closest for the hosts, his smart overhead kick just flying wide, while the out of sorts Daniel Johnson blasted way over. Joe Garner felt he should\u2019ve been awarded a penalty after being clattered by Frank Fielding. Steve Cotterill, knowing results elsewhere dictated they could still clinch elevation by five o\u2019clock, clearly put a rocket up his free scorers at the break. Before then they had threatened from free-kicks, managed to get into decent positions, but didn\u2019t threaten nearly enough. Wilbraham got on the end of James Tavernier\u2019s wicked cross from the right, but his shot was superbly tipped onto the bar by Sam Johnstone. Kieran Agard failed to stretch far enough to convert from two yards shortly afterwards. Preston were on the ropes, their biggest crowd in two years growing restless immediately after half-time. That was until Jermaine Beckford popped up, five yards out, to send Deepdale delirious just before the hour mark. Paul Gallagher picked up on lapse defending to take control of the situation inside the away box, firing across goal for Beckford to sweep beyond Fielding. At that stage, it took Simon Grayson\u2019s side seven points ahead of MK Dons - drawing at Port Vale - in third. But they only managed to hold the lead for four minutes, Aden Flint intelligently flicking a header towards the middle of the six-yard box for Wilbraham to power home in front of the travelling band from the West Country, his 20th of the season. Grayson will be frustrated at the way in which his side switched off from a routine set piece. This could\u2019ve been a day they made the title race very interesting indeed. As it was, Agard forced Johnstone into another decent save, diving down to his right to tip wide on the angle, as Cotterill\u2019s side searched for a winner.

Iran has agreed to restrict its nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. Now in his seventh year in office, Obama cast the Iran talks as part of a broader foreign policy doctrine that sees American power as a safeguard that gives him the ability to take calculated risks. 'We are powerful enough to be able to test these propositions without putting ourselves at risk,' he said, citing his overtures to Cuba and Myanmar as other examples of his approach. The president's comments come days after the U.S. and other world powers reached a tentative agreement to curb Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. The framework cleared the way for negotiators to hammer out technical details ahead of a June 30 deadline for a final deal. Negotiations: Secretary of State John Kerry, right with Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz, was involved in the nuclear talks in Lausanne, Switzerland. Obama argued that successful negotiations presented the most effective way to keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, but insisted he would keep all options on the table if Tehran were to violate the terms. 'I've been very clear that Iran will not get a nuclear weapon on my watch, and I think they should understand that we mean it,' Obama said in the interview published Sunday. 'But I say that hoping that we can conclude this diplomatic arrangement \u2014 and that it ushers a new era in U.S.-Iranian relations \u2014 and, just as importantly, over time, a new era in Iranian relations with its neighbors.' The president said there are many details that still need to be worked out with the Iranians and cautioned that there would be 'real political difficulties' in implementing an agreement in both countries. He reiterated his opposition to a legislation that would give the U.S. Congress final say in approving or rejecting a deal, but said he hoped to find a path to allow Congress to 'express itself.' Victory? Obama looked forward to 'a new era' of relations with Iran. Pictured above is the nation's president, Hassan Rouhani. The White House plans an aggressive campaign to sell the deal to Congress, as well as to skeptical Arab allies who worry about Iran's destabilizing activity in the region. The president has invited leaders of six Gulf nations to Washington this spring and said he wanted to 'formalize' U.S. assistance. On the substance of the Iran framework agreement, Obama outlined more specifics of how the U.S. would seek to verify that Tehran wasn't cheating. He said there would be an 'international mechanism' that would assess whether there needed to be an inspection at a suspicious site and could overrule Iranian objections. The nuclear talks have marked a remarkable shift in the frozen relationship between the U.S. and Iran. It has become normal for officials from both countries to communicate and hold face-to-face meetings. Obama is yet to meet with Iranian President Hasan Rouhani, though they did speak on the phone. He has also exchanged letters with Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Obama said the letters include 'a lot of reminders of what he perceives as past grievances against Iran.' But he said the concessions Khamenei allowed his negotiators to make in the nuclear talks suggests that 'he does realize that the sanctions regime that we put together was weakening Iran over the long term, and that if in fact he wanted to see Iran re-enter the community of nations, then there were going to have to be changes.'", "summary": "President defended negotiations that will lift sanctions on Iran.

It's the difference between a good holiday and an adventurously good holiday - with some embarrassment thrown in. On day one, after manoeuvring our rented boat into sheltered waters off Kastani beach, I cut the throttle and my girlfriend threw out the anchor. Splash! Splendidly small: Skopelos has a relaxed, offbeat vibe that plays out in the pretty port of Chora. As the breeze pushed us back, the short anchor line quickly ran out until the end - then we heard a softer, more ominous splash. We hadn't noticed that the end wasn't secured. The rope sank fast. Oh dear. But our shame was admirably handled by the boat owners, who promptly gave us a second anchor, and assured us they would retrieve the original. This generosity of spirit set the tone for our week on this hilly, pine-forested island. Skopelos is known as the film location for Mamma Mia! and I had feared there might be endless reminders of the day when Meryl Streep's Donna found love. I need not have worried. The island lies in the Sporades, east of the mainland. With no airport, most people fly to Skiathos, followed by an hour's ferry ride. Arriving in Skopelos is special. Seal of approval: Kyle encountered two locals of the bewhiskered variety while sailing around Slopelos. It has one of the most scenic ports in Greece. Wooded hillsides are punctuated with white walls topped by terracotta-tiled roofs. A ruined Venetian fortress and dozens of chapels make you feel that this is a spiritual retreat. Many of the chapels were built by families as status symbols and are owned and maintained by their descendants, rather than by the Greek Orthodox Church. We opted for a villa. Up a steep hill from Skopelos town, and along a dirt track (vehicle needed) lies Villa Thea, with its cool stone floors, pool and large terrace. In the evenings, the lights from town twinkle and moonlight shimmers on the water. Thalpos Holidays Boat Hire operates out of sheltered Panormos beach on the west coast, a 20-minute drive from Skopelos town. With guidance from Mr Thalpos himself, the coastline was ours to explore in a 30hp motorboat. One day, we headed north, anchoring at the pine-fringed Neraki beach, which we had to ourselves, as it is only accessible by boat. Picnic perfection. The adjacent islet of Dasia comprises little more than rocks jutting out of the blue sea, but our appetite for maritime adventures was well rewarded here. Watching the whiskered faces of two monk seals rolling lazily in the sea was unforgettable. These shy, endangered marine mammals - once widespread around the Mediterranean and beyond - are now limited to small ranges, one of which is close to Skopelos. Glossa is a smaller town in the north, and its white-washed houses are as authentic as you might wish, with few compromises to mass tourism. We spent an enjoyable evening here before reaching one of the stars of the island, Agnanti, a restaurant perched high on a hilltop. Owner Nikos offers visitors fine traditional seafood as well as slow-cooked pork, and the terrace has some of the most spectacular views on the island. We were tempted to exclaim: 'Mamma mia!' Instead, we wondered how quickly we could return to this gorgeous island. It won't be soon enough.

He immersed himself in fatherhood -- twice over, you might say. He used his photography to document the real-life experience of other fathers taking full advantage of Sweden's extraordinary program, which allows mothers and fathers to take long, long leaves from their careers so they can care for their newborns. Get this: Sweden grants a total of 480 calendar days of parental leave, with 390 of them paid at 80% of income, with a maximum of 3,160 euros a month or $3,474. The remaining 90 days are paid at a flat-rate benefit of 20 euros a day, or $22. But there's a catch. Fathers have to share that leave with mothers. So to promote both parents to raise their children, Sweden has mandated that 60 of the 480 days be \"daddy months\" or \"partner months.\" If the 60 daddy days aren't used, they are lost, reducing the maximum leave to 420 days. The country also created a \"gender equality bonus\": the more days that parents share the leave equally, they get a bonus that could total up to 1,500 euros, or $1,649. The idea is for both parents to share the joys and struggles of raising infants. In reality, only 12% of Swedish couples equally share the 480 days of leave, Bavman said, with women continuing to lead the way as the stay-at-home parent and men as the careerist. Still, Bavman mused last summer about how the policy impacts those men who use the full measure of their parental leave. Social media. Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. At first, Bavman had difficulty finding such men. But the fathers he did find and photograph, he captured their devotion in realistic imagery. \"I realized while I was talking to these dads, these dads are struck by how important the bonding is between you and the children,\" said Bavman, who now has a 3-year-old son, Viggo, with partner Linda Stark, a freelance journalist. \"I didn't want to bring out fathers as superdads,\" Bavman said. \"I wanted to bring out these role models which people can connect to. \"I want to have those dads who can also show their tiredness... which comes with being home with your children. It's a hard full-time job. This is something that we have been taking for granted for hundreds of years. This is something that mothers have never been recognized for.\" He also found moments of humor, with one child nearly ripping apart the shirt of his busy father. The fathers have become more understanding of their wives and even their own mothers, Bavman said. Some are now considering a career change to accommodate their parenthood. \"Being home nine months, they get time to think about their life,\" the photographer said. Bavman is looking for a total of 60 fathers to photograph, to culminate in an exhibition and a book. So far he's found 35 worthy of his lens.

The size 14 beauty lived with a group of standard 'skinnier' models during her stint working in New York, and says that their agents instructed them to stick to a diet of 'one cracker and a couple of glasses of water'. 'It goes to the extremes,' Wells told the Australian Women's Weekly. 'No food being eaten, prescription dietary pills, agents telling girls that they're only allowed to have one cracker and a couple glasses of water leading up to fashion week per day.' Scroll down for video. Shocking: Laura Wells (left) spoke to Australian Women's Weekly about the pressure put on her 'skinnier' model room mates to not eat ahead of Fashion Week. 'It's completely unhealthy, not only for their body but mentally as well.' Laura told AWW editor Helen McCabe that her model friends would then compare themselves to her, who was working non-stop despite eating what she likes. 'These girls are going to extremes to look like that, and then not being booked for any jobs,' she said. 'And then living with a plus size model who's working every single day and comparing themselves to me. 'I eat healthy, I work out, but I'll let myself have a treat every now and then and have a glass of wine. Healthy and happy: Wells says her room mates, who struggled to book jobs, compared themselves to her as she was highly in-demand despite allowing herself treats. 'They couldn't fathom the fact that they were putting themselves through so much stress and I was so happy with myself.' Wells' comments comes days after France passed legislation banning excessively thin models from participating in Paris Fashion Week. Agents and fashion houses that hire them could also face fines under the new law, which was passed on April 3. The move by France, with its fashion and luxury industries worth tens of billions of euros, comes after a similar ban by Israel in 2013, while other countries, like Italy and Spain, rely on voluntary codes of conduct to protect models. Diet: Laura (pictured with Sarah Wilson, right) revealed that there was 'no food being eaten, and prescription dietary pills' being consumed by her model friends in New York. The measure is part of a campaign against anorexia by President Francois Hollande's government. Lawmakers also made it illegal to condone anorexia and said any re-touched photo that alters the bodily appearance of a model for commercial purposes must carry a message stating it had been manipulated. 'The activity of model is banned for any person whose Body Mass Index (BMI) is lower than levels proposed by health authorities and decreed by the ministers of health and labour,' the legislation says. The lawmaker behind the bill previously said models would have to present a medical certificate showing a BMI of at least 18, about 55 kg (121 lb) for a height of 1.75 metres (5.7 feet), before being hired for a job and for a few weeks afterwards. Dangerous: Wells' comments come days after France passed a law banning excessively thin models from the catwalk, with agents and fashion houses to face fines and imprisonment if they don't comply. The law, voted through the lower house of parliament by Hollande's Socialist majority despite opposition by conservative parliamentarians, envisages imprisonment of up to six months and a fine of 75,000 euros ($82,000) for any agency contravening it. In the AWW video interview, Laura Wells recalls wanting to 'punch' a model scout when they suggested she could get work as a plus-size model. The 177-centimetre beauty was studying science and law when she was spotted in New York City by talent scouts in 2005. She said she felt insulted the first time she was asked to be a plus-sized model because of her misconceptions about the term. 'I thought they were calling me fat': Laura also revealed that she was initially insulted by the suggestion she should be a plus-size model, and admits she wanted to punch the model scout. 'I wanted to punch everyone in the face... [I thought] basically they were calling me fat,' Wells said. 'That was my perception of the word 'plus size', that people were calling me 'fat'.' Wells said while she was a plus-sized model who was defined as someone who was 'four to six sizes bigger than a standard model', she was not 'plus-sized in reality'. Since then Wells has gone to model for Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Myer, David Jones, Berlei and ASOS. Despite her career breakthroughs, she thinks people's perception of body image still has a long way to go. 'It's slowly changing but not to the extent where it needs to be,' Wells said.

Hospital staff were amazed when the youngster, from Stretford, asked if he could decorate the protective mask that holds him still while having his treatment. Harley Renshaw has been told he is cancer-free after battling an aggressive form of the disease for a year. He donned a superhero costume during his radiotherapy treatment, to help him feel brave. Harley asked if he could decorate the protective mask that holds him still while having his radiotherapy treatment like a Ninja Turtle. After Harley's story made headlines around the world, staff at children's TV channel Nickelodeon even sent Harley a box full of Ninja Turtle presents for Christmas. And now doctors given Harley's parents Oliver, 25, and Stacey, 23, the news they had not dared to dream of - he is free of cancer. He will undergo regular check-ups over the coming years to make sure he stays free of the disease. Mr Renshaw said: 'We're chuffed to bits. Harley is doing great. It was just over a year ago that he was diagnosed and he has been through it. 'He's been running about everywhere and we're hoping that he will soon be back at school full time.' Mr and Mrs Renshaw were given Harley's devastating diagnosis after taking him to see a doctor when he complained of a pain in his stomach. He was diagnosed with neuroblastoma - a rare and aggressive childhood cancer which affects fewer than 100 children in the UK. Harley was diagnosed with cancer in his kidney, lung, bones and neck after mother Stacey took him to a doctor with a stomach pain. Harley's story became famous after it was reported in the local paper in December last year. The children's TV channel Nickelodean even sent him a whole box of Ninja Turtles presents for Christmas. Neuroblastoma is cancer of specialised nerve cells, which are involved in the development of the nervous system. The tumours usually start in one of the adrenal glands found above the kidneys, or in nerve tissues that run along the spinal cord, in the neck, chest, abdomen or pelvis. As in Harley's case, the cancer can also spread to other areas of the body. After doctors diagnosed his tumour, Harley faced 80 days of intensive chemotherapy and an operation to remove his kidney tumour. A month later, he was back at hospital for a stem cell transplant \u2013 also called a blood or marrow transplant - where healthy stem cells were injected into his body to replace damaged or diseased stem cells. He suffered complications as a result of the procedure, but battled through them to return home for his fifth birthday. He also had weeks of radiotherapy at The Christie clinic in Manchester. Finally, he and his parents were given the incredible news that he was cancer-free. Harley's father said he is 'so chuffed' his son is cancer-free. 'Harley is doing great,' he said. 'He's been running about everywhere and we're hoping that he will soon be back at school full time' His bravery caught the attention of doctors in the hospital and he was awarded one of Cancer Research UK's Little Star Awards. He has also become the face of the charity's Kids and Teens Campaign, which aims to raise funds for research into child cancers. Mr Renshaw said Harley's family are overjoyed to be told he is free of cancer. He added: 'We're just really excited and looking forward to the future.'

Fewer than 100 children in the UK are diagnosed each year with the disease. Most children diagnosed with the disease are younger than five years old. It is the second most common solid tumour in childhood, and it makes up 8 per cent of the total number of children's cancers. Neuroblastoma commonly occurs in either one of the two adrenal glands in a child's tummy or in nerve tissue that runs alongside the spinal cord, in the neck, chest, abdomen or pelvis. The cancer can spread to tissues beyond the original site, including bone marrow, bone, lymph nodes, liver and skin. As with most cancers the cause of neuroblastoma is unknown. A neuroblastoma cancer cell in the brain is pictured under the microscope.\u00a0Fewer than 100 children in the UK are diagnosed each year with this form of cancer. The symptoms vary depending on where a child's tumour is. The first signs can be vague, and include tiredness, a loss of appetite and pain in the bones. If the tumour is in a child's tummy, it may be swollen and the child may complain of constipation or have difficulty passing urine. Where a tumour is growing in a child's chest, they may be breathless and have difficulty swallowing. Tumours growing in the neck can be visible as a lump, and a child is likely to complain of breathing and swallowing problems. In cases where a tumour is pressing on the spinal cord, children can experience a weakness in the legs and walk unsteadily. A variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose neuroblastoma. Treatment depends on the age of the child, as well as the size and position of the tumour and whether the disease has spread. Children can have surgery, chemotherapy, as well as antibody treatment and radiotherapy.

The England international has been abused, even by his own fans, over his decision to put deal talks on hold after rejecting an offer worth \u00a390,000-per-week. Sterling was even heckled at the club's recent kit launch, but the 20-year-old, speaking for the first time since his now infamous BBC interview, insists he is immune to the negative comments. Raheem Sterling says he pays no attention to criticism levelled at him for contract stand-off with Liverpool.

Sterling is wanted by all the Premier League's top clubs, as well as Real Madrid and Juventus. Nevertheless, Sterling, who has scored 11 goals this season, admits there's still much more to come from him. Sterling added: 'I set targets for myself at the start of the season and I\u2019m probably a few goals behind where I wanted to be. 'I\u2019m just taking it in my stride and hopefully in these last few games, the run-in until the end of the season, I can kick on again. I\u2019m still learning and developing so only time will tell. 'I\u2019m my own biggest critic. I don\u2019t need anyone to tell me when I\u2019ve played badly.

Cecil Hamilton-Miller, from Kensington, London, was responsible for the convictions of 31 concentration camp guards in 1945, including several key Belsen figures, such as camp commander Josef Kramer and Dr Fritz Klein. Mr Hamilton-Miller, who died in 2001, aged 91, struggled to talk to about the horrors he witnessed during the holocaust or the role he played after the liberation of Belsen, his family has said today. Hero: Cecil Hamilton-Miller, pictured as Mayor of Glastonbury, was part of the team that prosecuted dozens of the men and women responsible for running the notorious Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp. Cecil Hamilton-Miller can be seen on the right, watching on as Bergen-Belsen camp commander Josef Kramer, known as The Beast of Belsen, is marched to his death at gunpoint following his trial in 1945. Despite his honourable actions in the wake of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp, which took place 70 years ago this month, many family and friends had no idea of his involvement. A historic photograph found by Mr Hamilton-Miller's family shows him watching on as camp commander Josef Kramer, known as The Beast of Belsen, is marched to his death at gunpoint following his trial. His cousin William Miller, 63, who has written a biography about the late solicitor, said: 'Cecil couldn't talk about his Belsen experience in later life without tears streaming down his face because of the traumatic memories. 'He never publicised his extraordinary war record but I am very proud of it - it must rate as the most important legal work of his career.' Prosecutor: Mr Hamilton-Miller served in India for much of World War II and arrived in Bergen-Belsen shortly after its liberation in May 1945. Bergen-Belsen was a Nazi concentration camp in Lower Saxony, Germany. It was initially intended to hold prisoners of war, but in 1943, parts of the camp became a 'transit camp' for, mainly Jewish, civilian prisoners,. The camp became the final resting place of some 20,000 prisoners of war and 50,000 Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Nazi opponents and disabled, and was is burned to the ground after its liberation by British and Canadian troops in April 1945. After qualifying as a solicitor in 1935, Cambridge educated Mr Hamilton-Miller was enlisted into the Territorial Army in 1936 and then, in 1939, was granted an emergency commission as 2nd Lieutenant in the Border Regiment. For much of the war he served in India, until in 1944 he returned to Britain on leave and was posted to Carlisle. This ended abruptly on April 15, 1945 when the 11th Armoured Division of the British Army liberated Bergen-Belsen. Recognising that the liberated camps on the continent would require military lawyers, Mr Hamilton-Miller was among those immediately posted immediately to the British Liberation Army, 49 Reinforcement Holding Unit, where he was appointed Staff Captain to 21 Army Group HQ, War Crimes Investigation Team, arriving at Belsen sometime after May 5 to a horrific, challenging and distressing scene. Mr Hamilton-Miller's role appears to have been to assist Major Savile Geoffrey Champion, head of No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Unit, Belsen, to prepare the legal cases against the SS camp personnel. Mr Miller added: 'Cecil's team opened a war crimes investigation office inside the camp and files were opened on each guard. 'Gradually written witness statements and other evidence built up in each file enabling decisions to be made as to whether and when the case against each guard was sufficiently clear and strong to progress to trial.' The first Belsen trial began on September 17, 1945, at Luneburg Town Hall and took the form of a Military Tribunal. Up in smoke: Bergen-Belsen, which became the final resting place of 20,000 POWs and 50,000 Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Nazi opponents and people with disabilities is burned to the ground after liberation in 1945. The trial of the prison guard, called Rothe, who killed a young girl by beating her was sentenced to ten years in prison. Mr Hamilton-Miller was also responsible for the camp commandant Kramer, the doctor, Dr Klein, and nine guards, being sentenced to death by hanging. Nineteen guards were sentenced to prison terms of between life and one year, with most of them having to serve between ten and 15 years. Mr Miller added: 'Many inmates at Belsen had been moved hurriedly from Auschwitz, and Cecil's unit took evidence from witnesses against Nazi criminals such as Dr Mengele, guards responsible for selecting people to go to the gas chambers, as well as conducting horrific medical experiments on them. 'Cecil appears to have remained in the Belsen posting until December 1945 after which he was sent home and demobbed.' Upon his return to the UK, Mr Hamilton-Miller re-qualified as a solicitor and married Sylvia Hurle. The pair lived in Glastonbury, Somerset, where Cecil lived for the majority of his life, becoming Mayor of the city in 1969.

Our thoughts and prayers, and that of the whole Nigerian nation, are with you today.\" The girls were abducted on the night of April 14-15, 2014, in the town of Chibok, in northeastern Nigeria, about a two-hour drive from the border with Cameroon. The Government Girls Secondary School had been closed for a month because of the danger posed by Boko Haram militants, who are opposed to Western education, particularly for girls. But students from several schools had been called in to take a final exam in physics. The militants stormed the school, arriving in a convoy of trucks and buses and engaging in a gun battle with school security guards. Then they forced the girls from their dormitories, loaded them into trucks and drove them into the forest. Most have never been seen since, except in a photograph in which they sat on the ground in a semi-circle, clad in Islamic dress. They were between 16 and 18 years old. Police said the militants kidnapped 276 girls in all. About 50 managed to escape soon after they were abducted. Those who did not, it is feared, may have been raped, brutalized, enslaved and forced to convert to Islam. Their parents were stricken with grief. The world was appalled. On Twitter, a hashtag began trending and spread around the world: #BringBackOurGirls. On Tuesday, Malala Yousafzai, the 17-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot in the face for speaking out in favor of girls' education, sent a message to the kidnapped girls. \"I am one of the millions of people around the world who keep you and your families foremost in our thoughts and prayers,\" she wrote. \"We cannot imagine the full extent of the horrors you have endured. But please know this: We will never forget you.\" One year later, a few things have changed. Each of the missing girls has had a birthday in captivity. Each is now a year older. Nigeria's current president, Goodluck Jonathan, was defeated in his campaign for re-election, in part, it is thought, because he failed to effectively combat Boko Haram. Buhari, the incoming president, has pledged an aggressive effort to wipe out the group. But much remains unchanged, as well. Boko Haram still controls swathes of northeastern Nigeria. According to UNICEF, 800,000 children have been forced to flee their homes because of the conflict between the Nigerian military, civilian self-defense groups, and Boko Haram. Amnesty International says women and children continue to be abducted. And it says Boko Haram continues to kill in large numbers. Beyond that, more than 200 schoolgirls who had gathered one year ago to take their science exam are still missing. Their families are still bereft.

Scientists analysed 57 species in the region and found that the majority of populations had diminished as a result of the nuclear accident. They found that one breed in particular had plummeted from several hundred before the 2011 disaster to just a few dozen today. Researchers have found that bird species are continuing to drop in Fukushima (shown after the disaster in 2011). The barn swallow, for example, dropped from hundreds to dozens. This is despite radiation levels in the region starting to fall. And comparing it to Chernobyl could reveal what the future holds. The research, published in the Journal of Ornithology, was carried out by scientists at the University of South Carolina including biologist Dr Tim Mousseau. They showed that the situation has steadily worsened since the disaster on 11 March 2011. On that day, just over four years ago, Japan\u2019s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was heavily damaged by an earthquake and its resultant tsunami. The Fukushima nuclear disaster was a failure at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant on 11 March 2011. It was caused when the plant was hit by a tsunami, triggered by the 9.0 Tohoku earthquake. This led to three of the plant\u2019s six nuclear reactors going into meltdown and releasing radioactive materials. Reports claim the soil and water in the region still contains high levels of radiation which makes the clean-up effort difficult. A total of 300,000 people evacuated the Fukushima area on the east coast and 15,884 people died due to the earthquake and tsunami. Many populations were found to have diminished in number as a result of the accident, with several species suffering dramatic declines. One of the most hard-hit species is the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica, which suffered large population losses due to radiation exposure. \u2018We know that there were hundreds in a given area before the disaster, and just a couple of years later we're only able to find a few dozen left,\u2019 said Dr Mousseau. \u2018The declines have been really dramatic.\u2019 And while background radiation has declined in the region in recent years, the negative effects of the accident on birds are actually increasing. \u2018The relationship between radiation and numbers started off negative the first summer, but the strength of the relationship has actually increased each year,\u2019 Dr Mousseau said. \u2018So now we see this really striking drop-off in numbers of birds as well as numbers of species of birds. \u2018So both the biodiversity and the abundance are showing dramatic impacts in these areas with higher radiation levels, even as the levels are declining.\u2019 Dr Tim Mousseau and his team made the findings using thermoluminescent detectors, which use gamma-radiation-sensitive crystals (shown) to measure radiation doses in individual subjects living in the wild. One hard-hit species was the barn swallow (stock image shown), Hirundo rustica, which suffered large population losses due to radiation exposure. The team are hoping to get information on what the future holds for Fukushima from the Chernobyl site, which was the scene of a devastating release of radioactive materials in Ukraine in 1986. One difference noticed so far is that migratory birds fared worse in Chernobyl, whereas it was year-round residents that were doing worse at Fukushima. This could be due to differences in DNA repair capabilities for migratory species as a result of flapping their wings - which lowers their antioxidant levels and makes them more vulnerable to radiation. The Fukushima nuclear disaster was a failure at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant on 11 March 2011. It was caused when the plant was hit by a tsunami, triggered by the 9.0 Tohoku earthquake.

The 39-year-old posted an Instagram picture of back of his head with eight needles stuck in his neck, accompanied by the caption: 'I feel like a pin cushion'. Ian Poulter shared an Instagram picture of what looked like a painful acupuncture session. The English golfer has used the alternative medicine technique to aid his recovery in the past. Poulter has just come off a strong finish at the US Masters where successive final rounds of 67 saw him finish tied sixth at Augusta, while sending a strong message to impressed Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke. 'I was proud of the way I played over the weekend - I only missed four greens in regulation in the final two rounds, which is a bit special around here,' Poulter said. 'I gave myself so many chances, and I could have even gone lower over these last 36. It makes the first couple of days even more frustrating, because I left far too many spots in really bad places - and I should know better at this place.' Clarke, who partnered Poulter at the event told Sporting Life: 'That's the best I have ever seen him play. It was a 67 that could have been a 63 standing on his head.'

World boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jnr. recently shared a video of himself receiving a SubZero recovery cool down in Las Vegas ahead of his $300million mega-fight with Manny Pacquiao in May. The treatment known as kriotherapy (or cryotherapy) involves exposing the body to freezing temperatures of -200C for between 1-3minutes to assist muscle recovery as well as decrease inflammation and soreness after a training session. Kriotherapy has also been used by the Wales rugby union team as well as Tottenham players including Andros Townsend, Christian Eriksen and Jan Vertonghen - while Real Madrid superstar has had his own 'ice chamber' installed at home.

If the victim had no money on them, they would be driven to a nearby cash point to withdraw it, or the trio would con their way into their homes before stealing from them. Albert Webb, 51, from Surrey, was jailed for three and a half years and son Jimmy Chuter, 26, was jailed for four years after they harassed pensioners with dementia in the street, demanding money. In total the family gang carried out 35 thefts, starting in February 2012 - when pensioners were still able to withdraw cash from their local Post Office. Most of the victims were women aged in their 70s or 80s, while the eldest was a 97-year-old man.

Jesse Webb, 19, was due to be sentenced with his father and brother, but went on the run. He was given a 12 month term this week after being caught. In fact, no work had been carried out, but because many of the elderly victims were suffering from dementia, they simply accepted what they were being told.

However, Mertesacker insisted Klopp, whose side are 10th in the Bundesliga table, will need time to decide on his future after a largely successful spell in Dortmund which has brought two league titles and a Champions League final appearance. He said: 'I think he should just finish the season with Dortmund and then he should be given time. 'We'll see what he does next, but I think he's fought his way out of all situations and I think that this time he will find a path that gives him a new challenge.

Prasanna \u2018Nick\u2019 Arulchelvam ran and jumped through an open side door of their van, but was pushed out and hit the ground as the vehicle sped away. A customer in the Costco car park in Watford where the incident happened reported hearing a \u2018nasty crunch\u2019 as the 34-year-old\u2019s head hit the ground. Today, the man who pushed Mr Prasanna to his death was jailed for 11 years after admitting all he wanted was \u2018a few cheap packets of cigarettes\u2019. Mr Prasanna had just finished his purchases when he returned to his silver Transit van and loaded a large box containing 21 smaller boxes of cigarettes in his van. He took his trolley back to a bay and returned to see that the stock he had bought had been disturbed, Luton Crown Court heard. Mr Prasanna then gave chase as he saw a separate van speeding off. Prosecutor John Price QC said: \u2018Mr Prasanna courageously acted in an attempt to stop the driver getting away. \u2018With equal determination and with an utterly callous regard for his safety, the two men used violence that cost this man his life. \u2018Mr Prasanna was forced out but managed to hold onto the side of the vehicle before the door was shut and he fell to the ground.\u2019 A witness said it was as if he had been pushed or kicked away from the van. Nothing had been taken from Mr Prasanna\u2019s van. Last October cousins Patrick and James O\u2019Driscoll were handed jail terms of ten-and-a-half years and seven-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Prasanna. The sentence of Patrick O\u2019Driscoll, who was driving the van, was later increased to 12 years on appeal. His cousin was in another vehicle at the scene while a third man, Michael McInerney, 34, was in the rear of the van Mr Prasanna chased. McInerney went on the run after he was arrested in December 2013 and bailed. A European Arrest Warrant was issued but he was arrested in Corby, Northamptonshire in December 2014. Today he was jailed for a total of 11 years - ten-and-a-half years for manslaughter, two years concurrent for conspiracy to steal, with six months consecutive from the suspended sentence. Defence barrister Henry Hughes said the father of three accepts responsibility for the death of a man who deserved no harm at all. Jailed: Michael McInerney was handed an 11 year sentence after admitting to pushing Mr\u00a0Prasanna. \u2018He will live with the horror of the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life.

He is described as a devoted and very loving father and husband. \u2018I can\u2019t help but compare Mr Prasanna who was a hard-working and lawful citizen with you. What example are you setting to your three children? \u201c. \u2018You applied violence to get Mr Prasanna off the vehicle. You pushed him out of the vehicle which began the chain of events that led to his death.\u2019 McInerney, from Borehamwood, Hertforshire, who was living at the time in Radwell, Bedforshire, appeared via a video link from Woodhill Prison, Milton Keynes. At an earlier hearing he pleaded not guilty to murder and not guilty to conspiracy to rob. His pleas of guilty to alternative charges of manslaughter and conspiracy to steal were accepted by the prosecution. He had 17 convictions for 32 offences and operated with alias names and false dates of birth.

The war had helped define Khomeini's regime, the Islamic Republic, which he had founded a year before Saddam Hussein invaded Iran. Khomeini galvanized the nation, both his supporters and growing opponents, to fight against the enemy. He dragged out the war for eight years, despite Saddam's willingness to accept a ceasefire, and thus stabilized the foundations of the Islamic Republic. By the time he ended the war, the economy was in shambles, and there was no sign of his die-hard volunteers. Since then, \"drinking a chalice of poison\" has became part of Iranian political lexicon, and many analysts have asked whether Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Khomeini's successor, would raise the chalice and surrender to demands by the West to end Iran's nuclear program. Like the war, Iran's defiance to halt its controversial nuclear program has defined Khameni's era. He has defied the West in the face of increasing economic pressure. Iran claims that its program is peaceful, but Khamenei's refusal to end uranium enrichment activities -- a process that can lead to making nuclear fuel as well as nuclear bombs -- has landed the country under crippling sanctions. The standoff with the West has stretched longer than the war. The agreement reached in Lausanne, Switzerland, however, marks a new chapter in the history of the country. If Iran can finalize a deal by June with the United States and its P5+1 partners, international investors, including Americans, would be able to invest in Iran for the first time in decades. Iran can develop its gas and oil fields, and the economy can leap forward. Desperate for a deal, whoever I called over the past week inside Iran was glued to their television sets, and tens of thousands poured out on the streets to celebrate the agreement late Thursday night. Iran's economy shrank after sanctions were intensified in 2012 and the value of the Rial, the Iranian currency, plunged to one-third of the U.S. dollar. Inflation soared and the bank accounts of ordinary Iranians were frozen overseas as a result of sanctions. Millions of Iranians are hoping that their lives will improve in the post-deal era. Despite the regime's propaganda that claimed the program enjoys wide support among people, critics inside the country publicly denounced nuclear policies. Ahmad Shirzad, a former member of parliament, denounced the program last year and said it had been \"against national interests.\" Another critic, Sadeq Ziba, said in December \"the nuclear program has hurt the country more than the war.\" Iranian politicians are divided between moderates -- led by President Hassan Rouhani, who wants to develop the economy -- and hardliners, who view the deal as a threat to the regime's ideology. The majority of people brought Rouhani to power in 2012, hoping that he would ease the sanctions. Many see the negotiations as a diplomatic necessity that would help sideline hardliners too. Yet the Lausanne agreement would not have been possible without the moderates' will and Khamenei's approval. Ayatollah Khamenei is 76. Last year, he underwent a long prostate surgery, which led to rumors that he might be gravely ill. His predecessor ended the war a year before his death. Whether Khamenei is seriously ill or not, many believe that because of his advanced age, he needs to put the country on a straight path before his death. So far, the regime has presented the deal as a win for itself. During 18 months of negotiations, the regime appeared determined not to succumb to Western demands and lose its right to uranium enrichment. The Lausanne agreement allows Iran to spin 5,000 centrifuges and avoid national humiliation. Khamenei can claim that Iran is the winner in the country's decade-long confrontation with the West -- a legacy that he wants to leave behind. He has not drunk the poison yet, not until June, when negotiators aim to iron out the final deal. But perhaps he has raised the chalice.", "summary": "Iran's first Supreme Leader made a bitter peace with Iraq's Saddam Hussein.

He is planning to run a Kickstarter campaign and is hoping to raise $30 billion (\u00a320 billion) to build a pipeline from Seattle to bring water to the state. But the proposal to build a pipeline hundreds of miles long has been declared 'highly illogical' by some experts. Scroll down for video. Former captain of the fictional Star Trek Enterprise, William Shatner (pictured) has revealed radical proposals in an interview with Yahoo News. He wants to build a 4ft-wide pipeline from Seattle down to California to transport water and solve the state's ongoing drought problem. He revealed the crowdfunding campaign in an interview with David Pogue from Yahoo News. Mr Shatner likened his project to a similar pipeline in Alaska - with, in this case, the pipeline running from Seattle to California down the I-5 highway. Since the year 2000, seven western states in the US has seen their driest periods in centuries: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. And scientists in California have warned that the region may be experiencing a century-long 'mega-drought'. The warnings came after sediment studies showed California is currently experiencing the driest spell since 1580, and that the regular rainfall seen during the last century is likely to have been a temporary deviation in a cycle of droughts and very occasional rainfall over the last 3,000 years. In 2013, California received less rain than in any year since its formation as a state in 1850. And the last four years have seen the worst conditions, with the entire state of California now declared to be experiencing a drought. The pipeline would reportedly be used to fill one of the rapidly drying lakes in California. He said Seattle was \u2018a place where there\u2019s a lot of water\u2019 - although its state, Washington, is also experiencing a major drought. Without going into specifics, Mr Shatner added he would need a \u2018large, four-foot pipeline\u2019 above ground to keep enough water flowing. On his website though, Shatner\u2019s Water, he is letting people suggest other ideas for what to do with the money - if the campaign is successful. If he doesn\u2019t get the funding he requires, Mr Shatner says he will give the money he raises to a politician. However, Kickstarter doesn\u2019t allow campaigners to keep any money if they don\u2019t reach their target, so Mr Shatner may need to use a site such as Indiegogo instead, which does. The funding campaign has not yet launched and cynics have suggested that the proposal was tongue-in-cheek, or may have been a joke. On Twitter, Mr Shatner responded to some of these comments by posting: \u2018I know I need experts and @algore and @elonmusk should be asked to weigh in and join the conversation,\u2019 he said. And responding to complaints that Washington was also experiencing a severe drought, he said: \u2018I think [Washington] folks are thinking I\u2019m coming in with football field sized sponges in the middle of the night to steal their water.\u2019 The ongoing drought is one of California's worst in history. The last four years have seen the worst conditions, with the entire state of California now declared to be experiencing a drought said the US Department of Agriculture. This graphic shows the areas that have been hit the worst.

California has had to drastically cut back on water use to deal with the four-year drought that continues to cause devastation. But the Washington Department of Ecology spokesman Dan Partridge said that Mr Shatner\u2019s plan was not necessarily the solution they needed. \u2018Frankly we found it highly illogical, to put it in \u201cStar Trek\u201d terms,\u2019 he said. \u2018This would involve so many obstacles, so many hurdles that it would have to overcome to become reality. \u2018Namely the water of Washington state, you have to acquire a number of rights to use that water and we would not be approving transfer of a huge volume of water out of our state at this point in time when we have a drought of our own to deal with.\u2019 Bone dry: A Californian farmer is pictured surveying his drought-hit land in San Luis Obispo County.", "summary": "Mr Shatner revealed his radical proposal in an interview with Yahoo News.

But his hopes of remaining England captain in the Ashes this summer hinge on what is going on back home. The opinions of ECB chairman-elect Colin Graves, new chief executive Tom Harrison and the man they eventually make director of cricket matter far more than what anyone in the Caribbean thinks. The three half-centuries Cook made in his last four Test innings of last summer count for little now as his battle to prove he remains the best man for the job nears crunch time. England captain Alastair Cook is not concerned about his failure to hit a Test hundred since May 2013. Cook remains England's leading century maker despite his recent failure to score a Test century. Cook (right, pictured with Gary Ballance) and his team-mates are preparing for England's second Test. The second Test that starts here is not exactly make or break for Cook but he needs runs and a victory as much as at any time in a career that has seen him score more Test centuries than any other Englishman. The decision of Graves and Harrison to sack Paul Downton as managing director and announce that they are looking for a new \u2018supremo\u2019 to replace him has placed Cook and Peter Moores under more pressure than ever. By definition, the new powers at the ECB cannot have been happy about the big decisions Downton made in a traumatic 14 months and few were bigger than the move to bring back Moores as coach and the continued backing of Cook. England could not have done much more to force victory in Antigua on a pitch deader than Monty Python\u2019s parrot but their failure to beat West Indies has made the remaining two Tests vital. Cook was both proactive and imaginative for much of that first Test but he is a captain who leads mainly by example and simply has to break a run that now sees him without a Test century for 33 innings. The statistics certainly make grim reading for Cook. In 21 of those 33 innings he has not passed 25 and his Test average of 45.65 is lower than at any time since the 2010-11 Ashes. Since the last of his 25 Test centuries, against New Zealand at Headingley in May 2013, he is averaging under 29. If England really do want a change at the top then it must come sooner rather than later, particularly if, as expected, they would bypass vice-captain Ian Bell and go straight to the man who now seems the heir apparent, Joe Root. The only way for Cook to stop the questions about his lack of a big innings is to replicate the form he has been showing in practice here with his new slightly open stance and go back to churning out the runs. \u2018I have been working with Goochie on a number of things, as you always do,\u2019 said Cook of his decision to work with Graham Gooch, his old mentor and the man he sacked as England batting coach. \u2018You\u2019re always trying to tinker with your technique and might fall into certain habits at various times in your career. Joe Root lays on the ground to check out the pitch while Cook (right) and Jos Buttler (centre) look on. Cook (left), Moeen Ali (centre) and Adil Rashid (right) go for a gentle jog at the National Cricket Ground Stadium. \u2018But the most important thing is not to concentrate too much on technique when you are out in the middle. You have to concentrate on what is important \u2014 the ball coming down to you, the situation you\u2019re in and the conditions. \u2018I\u2019m a resilient guy who tries to play each ball on its merits for as long as possible, that\u2019s what my success has been built on, and I remain desperate to set the tone at the top of the order with some runs.\u2019 It was hoped that the pitch at a National Stadium here that was rebuilt after the devastating hurricane of 2004 would have a bit more pace than Antigua but Cook expressed his \u2018surprise\u2019 at how wet and soft it was, at least on Sunday. That means England will consider bringing in leg-spinner Adil Rashid for Chris Jordan, while Moeen Ali looks certain to return in place of James Tredwell, who has been \u2018struggling\u2019 with a shoulder problem suffered in Antigua. The \u2018big two\u2019 of record-breaking Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad will both play despite a demanding first Test while Jonathan Trott, rightly, carries on as opener with Cook despite his two failures on his return to the side in Antigua. There is much promise in this England team, particularly in a middle order that will see one of Moeen, Jos Buttler or Ben Stokes batting as low as eight, but questions remain about the man at the top. It is up to Cook to answer them. Cook warms up during the England nets session at the National Cricket Ground Stadium in St George.

They will inspire their team-mates with their discipline, character and application, just as Mike Atherton inspired me with the way he batted to save a Test in Johannesburg and in his famous battle with Allan Donald at Trent Bridge. This is an era in which West Indies are losing players to the easier option of the Indian Premier League and it is understandable because of the money that can be made there. Why shouldn\u2019t they cash in? Marlon Samuels (right) celebrates reaching his century for West Indies in second Test. But Samuels has taken the difficult road. It is all well and good going off and having a bit of a hit and giggle but he will take a lot more satisfaction from the way he has taken on the moving ball in a demanding Test match. These are the types of innings you remember when you retire. He will remember his duel with Ben Stokes, the way he saw off a newish ball and how he took the attack to England on the first evening. He did finally fall to Jimmy Anderson after a loose shot but by that time Samuels had grafted his way to 103. That is what you get in Test cricket. This is far harder than going off towards the end of your career and enjoying an IPL sunset. I never played in an easy Test. There is no easy option during five hard-fought days and that\u2019s why this game gives you far more satisfaction than you will ever get over 50 or 20 overs. It gets me down to hear people saying \u2018wasn\u2019t Antigua boring\u2019 or \u2018these pitches are just too dead and the cricket is slow\u2019. Just give this time. The Test England won in the dark of Karachi was remembered for years because it was the ultimate conclusion to three hard Tests. The same could happen here. I can see a lot of our England side of 2000 in this West Indies team. We could not become a winning side straight away. West Indies batsman Samuels grafted his way to 103 against England in the second Test. We had to stay in games, instil a bit of pride and discipline before we could think about being positive and that\u2019s what Simmons is trying to do here. The first step is to take Tests into five days and once that is achieved then West Indies can think about moving on and hopefully keeping their best players. The seven days we have had so far in this series may not have satisfied those who prefer their gratification instant but I have enjoyed it. This is not to denigrate Twenty20 or what we saw at the World Cup but there is something fulfilling about seeing a match go to the fifth day as in Antigua, with England bowling 130 overs and trying to find different ways to take 10 wickets. We live in a modern world of instant news where Test cricket seems something of a throwback but there is still great satisfaction to be taken from a slow burner. Ben Stokes was admonished by umpire Steve Davis following clash with Samuels. I find the mental side of Test cricket to be unparalleled. To be Jonathan Trott, for instance, getting a duck in his first innings after waiting to get back in for 18 months. Then he has to spend the best part of two days fielding and sweating on a pair. You can\u2019t replicate that in any other form of the game. Someone like Alastair Cook has to tackle a technical issue, having been found out by opponents, and has the mental battle to overcome it. There is the physical challenge of a bowling attack spending all that time in the heat trying to bowl a side out and then having to go through it all again. In Twenty20 you can have a bit of a slog, edge through the slips for four to get you off and running and then get caught on the boundary which is supposed to happen in the short game. I thoroughly enjoy the different attractions of limited-overs cricket. But Test cricket is what players will be remembered for.

'Such a project would need vast resources and would be very hard to keep covered up, yet many think this is what is happening and that these activities are being carried out in conjunction with one or more alien species.' The latest discovery follows a spate of supposed 'sightings' of Martian civilisation. Last year, a Maryland-based UFO hunter spotted what he believed to be a 'decorative' box on the red planet. Other objects found in images of Mars include what some UFO hunters claim to be a fossilised iguana (left). Stock image of an iguana is pictured right.

The 'coffin' was discovered by Will Farrar from WhatsUpintheSky37 as he trawled through a library of pictures sent back by the Mars rover Curiosity. Many scientists believe that seeing strange objects, such as a 'coffin' on Mars, is simple a case of pareidolia. This is a psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random places. It is a form of apophenia, which is when people see patterns or connections in unconnected data. There have been multiple occasions when people have claimed to see religious images and themes in unexpected places, especially the faces of religious figures. Many involve images of Jesus, the Virgin Mary and the word Allah. For example, in September 2007 a callus on a tree resembled a monkey, leading believers in Singapore to pay homage to the Monkey god. Another famous instance was when Mary's face was a grilled cheese sandwich. Images of Jesus have even been spotted inside the lid of a jar of Marmite and in a potato. 'This little box sure does look like a modern coffin concrete liner,' he wrote on his YouTube channel. 'As well as the stonework on the back part of the hill that looks like stairs or some left over stonework from some old civilisations constructions.' Alien researcher Scott Waring of the UFO Sightings Daily said he believes the coffin was made from a stone-like substance. 'What would it take to get Nasa to turn the rover around and examine the contents of this box?,' he said. But while its strong lines have captured the imagination of UFO bloggers, scientists believe sightings such as this are down to a psychological phenomenon called Pareidolia. This describes the brain's response to seeing faces and other significant objects in random places. It has evolved so that human eyes can spot faces within their environment, and to help them recognise friends in a crowd. Scientists claim we also tend to use this ability to 'enrich our imagination' and recognise meaningful shapes, even when they're not there. 'I stand ready to be convinced that I have possibly hallucinated. I won't mind being told that I'm wrong,' Cignac says.

Many clubs will be looking to snap up a bargain free transfer and there are plenty to choose from. Here are best players who are currently set to leave their Premier League clubs on a free in June. Manchester City's tenacious, \u00a0creative and versatile midfielder James Milner could leave as a free agent. Goalkeeper - Gerhard Tremmel (Swansea) At 36 years old, he is no spring chicken, but Tremmel could prove a useful acquisition for a newly-promoted side. Tremmel has played second fiddle to Michel Vorm and then Lukasz Fabianski during his four years at Swansea, but has performed well when called upon in the cup competitions and was in goal when the Swans beat Bradford in the Capital One Cup final two years ago. Swansea's Gerhard Tremmel, 36, is the understudy for Lukasz Fabianski but has done well in the cups. Right-back - Glen Johnson (Liverpool) England's first-choice right-back at the World Cup is still a regular for Liverpool, but he looks almost certain to end his six-year spell at Anfield this summer. Johnson, who has 54 England caps, is on a bumper deal at the Merseyside club and there seems to be little appetite to keep him on the books. England's first-choice right-back at the World Cup looks set to leave Liverpool after six years this summer. Centre-back - Kolo Toure (Liverpool) Another regular at Liverpool who is still to extend his contract. Toure kept Cristiano Ronaldo quiet with an excellent display when Real Madrid came to Anfield in November, but the 34-year-old Ivorian lacks consistency and has made some terrible gaffes in his time at the club. Inconsistency has been Kolo Toure's curse - the 34-year-old Ivorian has produced some howlers at Liverpool. Centre-back - Ron Vlaar (Aston Villa) Vlaar performed so well at the World Cup that his omission from the team of the tournament raised a few eyebrows, especially when Thiago Silva was selected ahead of him. Injury has restricted the Dutchman to 16 appearances for Villa this season. At 30, he has at least a couple of years left in him yet and will surely be courted by other top-flight teams. Holland's Ron Vlaar was a surprise omission from the team of the World Cup but could leave Aston Villa. Left-back - Luke Garbutt (Everton) Everton have been doing everything they can to tie this promising young defender down to a new deal, but he is yet to put pen to paper. The 21-year-old has played nine times for Everton this year and faces a big battle to displace Leighton Baines so he may fancy a challenge elsewhere. Everton want to lock the talented 21-year-old Luke Garbutt down for the long term but he's yet to commit. Right wing - James Milner (Manchester City) Probably the most high-profile free agent available this summer, Milner has 15 years' worth of top-flight experience to his name and 53 England caps. Milner is both tenacious and creative, either in the centre of midfield or out wide, and he is still a year off his 30th birthday. Milner has 15 years in top flight experience, 53 England caps and still isn't 30, so a great buy for someone. Central midfield - Mikel Arteta (Arsenal) Named Arsenal captain last summer, but Arteta has not played for the Gunners since November due to injury. Hard to see him displacing the in-form Francis Coquelin on his return. May be 33, but still has a good eye for a pass and is also a free-kick specialist. Mikel Arteta hasn't played for Arsenal since November due to injury and will need to displace Francis Coquelin. Central midfield - Tom Cleverley (Manchester United) Named captain for a tour match against Roma last summer, Cleverley clearly thought he had a future under new United manager Louis van Gaal. 'I think I'm going to be his type of player,' he said. But alas, that did not prove to be the case. The 25-year-old was farmed out on loan to Aston Villa, where he has played 30 times. He is not wanted back at United. Villa and Everton are keen to sign the England international. Unwanted by Manchester United, Aston Villa and Everton want to sign England international Tom Cleverley. Left wing - Jonas Gutierrez (Newcastle) Bravely battled back from testicular cancer to return to the Newcastle squad last month, but is no longer wanted by his club.

It's designed to teach the immune system to recognise compounds found in prostate cancer cells and is being given to men who have already been treated for the cancer. The vaccine is made from pieces of a protein called TARP that's found in about 95 per cent of prostate cancers. Animal studies have shown that the protein can effectively stimulate the immune system to attack the cancer. The thinking is that the vaccine will prime the immune system so that it creates antibodies when it detects TARP-related cancers. Then, should the cancer reappear, the antibodies will be dispatched to attack the malignant cells. Those antibodies, along with other immune cells, can then destroy cancer cells without harming non-cancer cells, so minimising side-effects. It is initially being tested as a way to treat cancer that has returned but, if successful, could be used as a first line treatment for prostate and potentially breast cancer in the future. TARP is also found in about 50 per cent of breast cancers. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year. In many cases the cancer develops slowly and patients may simply be monitored rather than actively treated. But in cases where the cancer is more aggressive, even after treatment there is a high risk of recurrence. Researchers at the U.S. National Cancer Institute are using the vaccine on 70 men who have been treated for the cancer, but whose PSA is rising again (posed by model) Once they have been treated, men are monitored with regular blood tests that check for a protein called prostate specific antigen or PSA, which can indicate cancer. The time it takes for the PSA reading to double is called the PSADT. Men with a PSADT of less than three months are at high risk of dying from prostate cancer. Around 11,000 men in the UK die from the disease a year. Researchers at the U.S. National Cancer Institute are using the vaccine on 70 men who have been treated for the cancer, but whose PSA is rising again. Men on the trial will have a PSADT greater than three months and less than 15. The trial will last nearly two years, and men will be given six injections of the vaccine or a placebo during that time.

Professor Raj Persad, urology consultant at the Bristol Urological Institute, says that the idea of boosting the body's own immune defences is an 'excellent strategy' for preventing a recurrence of the disease. 'Toxicity studies will have to be done, and then clinical effectiveness studies are needed, and it will need to be compared to existing treatments,' he says. 'But despite these time constraints, the research looks very promising indeed and we must watch this space.' Meanwhile, the MMR vaccine may be a new way to tackle problem warts. Researchers have found that injecting the vaccine into warts that have resisted other treatments leads to six out of ten disappearing. Warts are caused by infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV). Although they can clear up without treatment within one to two years, about a third or more do not resolve and may multiply and enlarge, making treatment more difficult. In the new study, researchers used the jab on 65 patients who'd had warts for between two and 15 years. They had an average of three treatments. In 63 per cent of cases, the warts disappeared, while 6 per cent showed no response. The remainder had some improvement. Side-effects included pain during injection, itching and flu-like symptoms. The warts recurred in only two patients, according to the researchers from Zagazig University, Egypt, whose findings are published in the International Journal of Dermatology. The theory is that the vaccine stimulates the immune system, which then spots and attacks the HPV virus and the warts it had previously overlooked.", "summary": "Vaccine is made from pieces of a protein called TARP.

(Only in the Big Apple can a doctor not afford an apartment!) The show was a breakthrough for on-screen representation \u2014 the first network sitcom created by and starring a woman of color \u2014 and it looks likely to be renewed for the coming 2015-16 season. Recently, however, Kaling's brother Vijay Chokalingam unveiled a project of his own, and while it has been getting a lot of attention, it hasn't generated quite as many laughs \u2014 either from observers or from his famous sibling, who told him it brought \"shame upon their family.\" You see, Chokalingam revealed that, as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, he engaged in a daring (his view) or ridiculous and offensive (pretty much everyone else) scam: He applied to medical school claiming to be African-American. Chokalingam had spent his college years as a \"hard-partying frat boy,\" and achieved a less than stunning 3.1 GPA. Upon facing graduation and exploring his med school options, he realized that fellow Indian-Americans with his grades were getting turned down from the universities of his choice \u2014 but that \"black, Hispanic, and Native American applicants with my grades and test scores were much more likely to gain acceptance.\" This revelation led him to make the decision to pose as a black man, both to \"dramatically improve\" his chances of admission, and to illustrate the unfair advantage that blacks and other underrepresented minorities receive when applying to prestigious schools. To accomplish this goal, Chokalingam shaved his head of its naturally wavy black locks, trimmed his \"long Indian-American eyelashes,\" checked \"black\" under the optional race/ethnicity declaration and submitted his application to 14 schools under his childhood nickname \"JoJo.\" He received invitations for in-person interviews at 11 schools, results that he claims support the notion that African-Americans garner special privileges that are unavailable to whites or Asians. And now that the statute of limitations on his act of fraud has expired, he's looking to write a book on his experiences, titled \"Almost Black: The True Story of an Indian American Who Got Into Medical School Pretending to Be an African American.\" What's truly curious is that even if you agree with Chokalingam that affirmative action is merely a form of \"systematic racism,\" when all is said and done, it offers very little evidence of the \"privilege\" that he claims is accorded to black, Hispanic and Native American candidates. Chokalingam had mediocre grades and MCATs, but he graduated from one of the most prestigious schools in the nation. Yet even while representing himself as black, Chokalingam received only a single admission offer, to St. Louis University's School of Medicine, which falls somewhere between 57th and 67th in national rankings. Harvard, University of Pennsylvania, Columbia and all the higher ranked schools he applied to rejected him. Meanwhile, he admits, pretending to be black came with disadvantages. He found himself being accused of shoplifting by store clerks and harassed by cops \u2014 who would regularly stop him while driving and demand that he tell them how much his car cost, implying that he must have stolen it. These acts of very real prejudice, experienced regularly by blacks and Hispanics of all backgrounds \u2014 multimillionaire comedian Chris Rock has recently been tweeting pictures of the occasions when he is pulled over by police for no reason \u2014 didn't seem to dissuade Chokalingam from his adamant belief in the unfairness of a system that seeks to address the shockingly low numbers of minority health practitioners by providing some weight to race and ethnicity in decision-making. It's not just a matter of what individual applicants \"deserve.\" One-third of Americans are black, Hispanic or Native American; just one in 10 physicians are. Since minority medical practitioners are up to three times as likely to practice in their own communities, this lack of diversity has produced \"doctor deserts,\" in which urban and rural ethnic enclaves across the nation go without access to primary care physicians. Years ago, when I told my father \u2014 a doctor from a long line of doctors \u2014 that I didn't want to follow in his footsteps, he told me that was fine, because medicine is a service trade, and anyone not interested in serving should avoid the profession. A medical degree isn't a reward to be earned, he said, but a responsibility to be accepted. Which really cuts to the heart of what's so sad about Chokalingam's racial farce. Like others who've recently been exposed for falsely claiming racial identities \u2014 including putative presidential candidate Jeb Bush, who registered himself as \"Hispanic\" on a 2009 voter form, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who was excoriated during her campaign for having claimed Native American ancestry in the past \u2014 Chokalingam wanted to claim the fruits of racial affiliation without having to carry black people's burden. Race isn't just about color or blood; it is about the collective experiences and inherited cultural context and present-day condition of a community of people. Many of the markers of race are persistently corrosive; others are deeply painful. Affirmative action programs are a means of redress for these awful realities of our nation's history; an imperfect one, but necessary. There are some fields where the imbalances might never correct themselves on their own. Industries like health care and Hollywood. Because what's most ironic about Chokalingam's decision to ride on his sister's coattails in telling his story: While Asians are well represented in medicine, our numbers are vanishingly low in the entertainment and media world, and until the recent breakthrough of modern pioneers like Mindy Kaling, it was impossible to imagine film and television that included our faces, voices and stories. Kaling's immense talent and charisma made her a star. But it was a quota-based affirmative action initiative -- NBC's Diversity Writers Program -- that gave her a start.", "summary": "Mindy Kaling's brother Vijay Chokalingam pretended to be black to get into med school.

But new research has found that Mother Nature might be making its own GM food, as sweet potatoes have been found to genetically modify themselves. And this seems to have been occurring for thousands of years, meaning humans have been unknowingly eating GM foods for much longer than they thought. Scientists in Belgium say all sweet potatoes (stock image shown) contain 'foreign DNA'. Agrobacterium bacteria in the crop exchanges genes between species. This makes sweet potatoes a 'natural genetically modified organism'. And humans have been eating it for thousands of years. The remarkable finding of \u2018foreign DNA\u2019 in the vegetable shows that it contains a type of natural genetically modified organism (GMO). The research was conducted by scientists from Ghent University in Belgium and the International Potato Institute (CIP). Sweet potato is one of the most important food crops for human consumption, especially in Sub-Sahara Africa, parts of Asia and the Pacific islands. It is one of the earliest domesticated crops with archeological findings in caves of the Cholca Canyon in Peru that are 8,000 to 10,000 years old. Despite the name, sweet potato is not related to potato; we eat the tuber from potato, while from sweet potato mainly the storage root is eaten. Other sweet potato parts are edible, such as the leaves. It is not the first instance of natural GMOs to be found, but it is the first in sweet potatoes - a major crop plant. And the researchers say sweet potatoes all over the world contain this genetic modification. The study focused around bacteria called Agrobacterium, sometimes referred to as \u2018nature\u2019s genetic engineer.\u2019 It is known to do something called \u2018horizontal gene transfer\u2019, which involves exchanging genes between different species - in contrast to normal gene transfer within one species. Agrobacterium is specialised to transfer part of its own DNA, called T-DNA, to plants - and it was this T-DNA that was found in sweet potatoes. In total the researchers studied 291 samples of sweet potato from the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania, and found evidence of Agrobacterium in all of them. Agrobacterium is known to do something called \u2018horizontal gene transfer\u2019, which involves exchanging genes between different species - in contrast to normal gene transfer within one species. This so-called transgenic process is similar to the artificial process induced by humans (stock image shown) Sweet potato (shown) is one of the most important food crops for human consumption, especially in Sub-Sahara Africa, parts of Asia and the Pacific islands.\u00a0It is one of the earliest domesticated crops with archeological findings in caves of the Cholca Canyon in Peru that are 8,000 to 10,000 years old. \u2018The natural presence of Agrobacterium T-DNA in sweet potato and its stable inheritance during evolution is a beautiful example of the possibility of DNA exchange across species barriers,\u2019 said Dr Lieve Gheysen, one of the researchers involved. \u2018It demonstrates that genetic modification also happens in nature.\u2019 The research suggests that the bacterial DNA may have adapted sweet potato for thousands of years in the natural process. The transgenic process - a gene that has been transferred naturally - is similar to the artificial process induced by humans. However, the difference pointed out by the resarchers is that we can control the man-made process, while the natural process is out of our hands. \u2018In comparison to \"natural\" GMOs, that are beyond our control, human-made GMOs have the advantage that we know exactly which characteristic we add to the plant,\u2019 said Dr Gheysen.", "summary": "Scientists in Belgium say all sweet potatoes contain 'foreign DNA' Agrobacterium bacteria in the crop exchanges genes between species.

That appears to be the primary message of a biography, just published by the Taliban, of the reclusive militant who is credited with founding the group in the early 1990s. The Taliban's \"Cultural Commission\" released the 11-page document in several different translations on the movement's website, ostensibly to commemorate the 19th anniversary of an April 4, 1996, meeting in Afghanistan's Kandahar province when an assembly of Afghans swore allegiance to Omar. Several Afghan observers say the biography is aimed at dispelling rumors of Omar's demise. \"There have been a lot of rumors lately about him. Some people are saying that he is not alive,\" said Sayyed Muhammad Akbar Agha, a former Taliban insider who has written an autobiography about his days with the movement. \"I think the Taliban thought it was an important time to release his biography to give assurances that he is alive and present,\" Agha told CNN in a telephone interview. Bergen: Why U.S. must stay in Afghanistan past 2016. The biography also appears to be an attempt to remind the world of the Afghan's jihadi leadership credentials, at a time when ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has declared himself \"caliph\" of the world's Muslims. \"The Taliban has a huge leadership problem at a critical political moment,\" said Graeme Smith, a Kabul-based analyst for the International Crisis Group. \"Another caliph has announced himself to the world, and the Taliban has been silent. And that is getting noticed by militants across South Asia.\" Omar was famously camera-shy during the Taliban's six-year rule over most of Afghanistan. To this day, there are only a handful of photographs of the one-eyed leader. \"He never was actively involved in any of these propaganda campaigns. No publicity. No interviews. He never used the Internet,\" said Rahimullah Yusufzai, a Pakistani journalist and expert on Afghanistan who once interviewed Osama bin Laden. Omar then all but disappeared after a U.S.-led bombing campaign routed the Taliban from Kabul in 2001. Washington has offered a $10 million reward for his capture. The Taliban have released written statements purportedly made by the leader-in-hiding. But years without any video or audio recordings of the fugitive have led to growing speculation that Omar may have died. The biography challenges rumors of Omar's death by offering a description of his daily work schedule, which begins with prayers, study of the Quran, and then delivering \"orders in a specific way to his Jihadi commanders.\" The publication also seeks to fill in some of the gaps about the militant's early years, including the detail that his \"preferred weapon of choice\" was the RPG-7, a rocket-propelled grenade. According to the biography, Omar was born in 1960 in a village called Chah-i-Himmat in Afghanistan's Kandahar province. His father, a \"well-known and respected erudite and social figure,\" died only five years later, apparently of natural causes. Omar studied at a religious school, or madrassa, run by his uncle. The rise of the Communist Party in Afghanistan, and the subsequent 1979 Soviet invasion, interrupted the young man's studies and propelled him into the arms of the armed Afghan opposition known as the mujahedeen. For the next decade, Omar commanded rebel groups \"against the invading Russians and their internal communist puppets,\" according to the biography. Along the way, he was wounded a number of times and was blinded in his right eye. In one battle, the biography claims, Omar and a fighter named Mullah Biradar Akhund destroyed four Soviet tanks, even though they were armed with only four RPG rounds. The Taliban biography makes no mention of the fact that the U.S., allied with Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, helped arm and bankroll the mujahedeen until the Soviet army withdrew in defeat in 1989. Afghan historians have documented the rapid rise of the Taliban in the chaotic years after the communist government in Kabul collapsed in 1992. The movement of warriors who identified themselves as religious scholars emerged to bring order to a country being ripped apart by rival mujahedeen warlords who battled one another for power. The Taliban biography says that Omar and his compatriots \"launched their struggle and fight against corruption and anarchy\" after an initial meeting in Kandahar in June 1994. Two years later, the Taliban captured Kabul and began imposing its austere interpretation of Islamic law on the rest of the country. While the document denounces the Taliban's post-9/11 overthrow at the hands of a U.S.-backed coalition of rival Afghan fighters, it makes no mention of the Taliban's alliance with bin Laden and al Qaeda. During a decade in exile, the Saudi-born bin Laden continued to release periodic video and audio statements until he was killed by U.S. raid on his hideout in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in 2011. Though Taliban militants have continued to battle the U.S.-backed government across Afghanistan, Omar has not been seen or heard from in years. The movement claims he continues to oversee a Taliban leadership council, judiciary and nine executive commissions, as well as military commanders who operate in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan.

Adam McBurney, who has been capped for the Ireland Under-20s and recently played in their Six Nations campaign, was not at his home in Cromkill in County Antrim, Northern Ireland when it was targeted on Easter Sunday. Shocked neighbours said he could have been killed if he was in the property, after bullets tore through the windows and ended up embedded in the kitchen and bathroom walls. Adam McBurney, who has been capped for the Ireland Under-20s (left), was not at home when a gunman fired multiple bullets through the windows of his property in County Antrim, Northern Ireland (right) on Sunday. Mr McBurney, who lives at the home with his brother Shane, 20, and is deemed a bright prospect for Irish rugby, is said to have returned to the house following the attack but is yet to speak about the incident. Photographs from the scene today show at least 12 bullet holes still visible in a living room window of the property, which is situated on a small housing estate alongside just seven other homes. Police Service of Northern Ireland said a number of shots were fired at the windows of the unoccupied house at 2.20am on Sunday. Detectives are now appealing for witnesses and said the incident had 'criminal elements'. Officers also said a red Honda Accord car, which is believed to have been involved in the incident, was found burnt-out in a nearby road shortly after the attack. Chief inspector Natalie Wilson said: 'This type of attack is totally unacceptable and there is no place for this type of activity in a civilised society. I know that the vast majority of people in Ballymena do not support those responsible. 'I want to reassure the Ballymena community that we are determined to tackle these criminal elements and as such we are committing additional resources over the next few nights. 'We will not accept this type of behaviour and I would ask for community support and information as we work to identify those responsible.' Police are appealing for witnesses to the incident which occurred when the house was unoccupied in the early hours of Easter Sunday. Investigators' markings showed at least 12 bullets hit one window of the house. Mr McBurney, who lives at the home on a quiet residental street in County Antrim with his brother Shane, 20, is deemed a bright prospect for Irish rugby and played in\u00a0Ireland U20's game vs France U20's (pictured above) One neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, described the incident as 'very worrying'. He told Belfast Live: 'It is fortunate the boys were not at home when these shots were fired into the living room because with that amount of shots flying about we very well could be talking about the death of one or two brothers, one of whom is one of the best young rugby stars in Ireland.' Adam McBurney is deemed one of the best young rugby stars in Ireland and there are hopes he will play internationally. The young player grew up playing for his local club Ballymena, and has also been associated with Randalstown RFC. He has since gone on to represent Ulster and Ireland and has been capped for the Ireland Under-20s \u2013 playing recently against Italy and France in their Six Nations campaign. He is also actively involved with the Belfast Met Rugby Academy- which blends intense professional rugby training with academic courses. Alongside rugby, McBurney works at Tullyglass House Hotel - an imposing country residence set in its own grounds on the outskirts of Ballymena. Another neighbour, Marie McKeown, 77, added: 'I heard the bangs and at first I didn't realise what it was. It woke me up. 'This is a very quiet area. I would be a light sleeper and I heard bang, bang, bang. I was shocked when I heard this happening. I hope it quietens down.' Following the attack, police cordoned off part of the housing estate and increased patrols in the area. It is believed, from the bullet casings found at the scene, that a nine-mm type weapon was fired with twelve rounds hitting the living room window and its frame. A further two strike marks were visible on the wall above the window. Bullets lodged in the kitchen and in the bathroom walls suggest that anyone who might have been in either room at the time of the shooting would most likely have been killed or suffered serious injury. Mr McBurney, who played for his local rugby club Ballymena before going on to represent Ulster and Ireland, inherited the property with his brother when their mother Heather died in December 2013.

Known for its empowering campaigns and championing of real women, Dove has taken a more brutal approach in its latest advertisement. Showing the harsh criticism that women regularly heap upon themselves, Dove decided to see what would happen when somebody else said those things, to their faces. Scroll down for video. For the new One Beautiful Thought ad campaign, Dove asked a group of women to write down every thought they had about themselves. The women filled in a notebook each, and handed it back to Dove. Unbeknownst to the women, those negative remarks and self-body shaming were turned into a script. Created in France, Dove asked a group of women - all beautiful and impeccably chic - to write down every thought they had about themselves in a notebook. The beauty brand then took the notes away with them. Unbeknownst to the women, those criticisms, negative remarks and tirades of self body-shaming were turned into a script. What happened next, shocked them all. Dove recruited two undercover actresses to read the script, created using the notes each of the women made about themselves, while they were all within earshot. Their reactions were priceless. The comments featured in the actresses' scripted dialogue were harsh, cutting and bordering on bullying. Played out by two actresses, the script was read aloud as dialogue in a cafe, where the women themselves had been invited for coffee. In the experiment set up by Dove, the women heard the actresses repeat their own thoughts to each other, out loud. Making for a shocking scene, the script, which contained nothing but the original notes, was cutting to say the least. One woman felt insecure about her teeth, noting that she thought they made her look like a mouse. When the actresses repeated the insecurity out loud, while sitting on the next table, her shock was obvious. In one scenario, a customer sitting on a nearby table, not involved in the experiment, even intervenes. 'Your arms are too big, your silhouette is all squashed,' reads one remark written by a woman who looks no bigger than a size eight. 'Sit up straight otherwise your belly looks big,' the same woman continues. Several of the women's messages to themselves echo the kind of schoolyard bullying we'd all frown upon.

The forward's treble - his first in two years - clinched a pulsating 3-3 draw with their drop rivals as Villa edged further clear of the bottom three. Villa are three points above the Barclays Premier League drop zone and denied QPR the chance to leapfrog them in the table. Christian Benteke scored a stunning hat-trick as Aston Villa drew 3-3 against Queens Park Rangers. Manager Tim Sherwood said that Benteke can fire Villa to Premier League safety. Defeat would have left Villa in the relegation zone and behind QPR but Benteke struck a 25-yard free-kick with seven minutes left to save them and complete his treble. The Belgium international has seven goals in seven games under Sherwood and the boss hopes he can maintain his form to keep Villa up. He said: 'That's the plan. 'It doesn't come much better than that. He's a good player, I have always said it and he's in a rich vein of form. 'It's fantastic for him to score the goals, it's just a shame we couldn't get the three points. 'It's not about what you deserve, it's about what you get and we got one point. 'This could be a vital point come the end of the season in the end, when you go so late into the game and Christian has had to pull that out the bag we're grateful.' But Sherwood insisted Villa should have won after Benteke's first-half double, cancelling out Matt Phillips' opener, gave them a 2-1 lead at the break. He said: 'It's disappointing when you dominate a football match like that, the ref should have stopped it at half-time. QPR were only ahead for three minutes in the first half after Benteke equalised for the hosts at Villa Park. Benteke drove beyond Rob Green from the edge of the box to net his seventh goal of the season early on. 'I thought we tired in the second half but that's to be expected and two of those back four have trained about four times in eight weeks. We dropped off a little bit too deep and couldn't keep that pressure on them. 'But anyone who has seen that football match knows it shouldn't have been close.' Rangers hit back after the break through Clint Hill and Charlie Austin, the latter netting with just 12 minutes left. They have taken four points from their last two away games after winning just once on the road this season before Saturday's 4-1 win at West Brom. The draw, though, left them two points from safety having played a game more and boss Chris Ramsey admitted he was nervous after Austin's goal. He said: 'It's a long time, it's heart attack time for managers that. You can see you're going to win but you know there's a chance anything can happen, a free-kick, a corner or a bit of magic. Benteke's added two more, including this wonder free-kick - much like Jason Puncheon's on Monday night. 'I thought we could (hang on) but a free-kick is a free-kick, at that stage most of their attacking options had been exhausted. 'I'm disappointed if I'm being honest. But before the game if someone said we'd get four points from the last two games we probably would have taken that.' Rangers were seeking back-to-back away wins in the top flight for the first time since 1995 but Ramsey targeted home victories to keep them up. They host Chelsea on Sunday before welcoming West Ham and Newcastle to Loftus Road. He said: 'I don't know what we need but we're probably going to have to win three games. I don't know what the points total will be but our two home games are going to be very important after Chelsea. 'We have got a couple of very difficult ones in Liverpool and Manchester City and then we have the potential cup final against Leicester on the last day of the season. 'Most teams would take being in it right to the end and then roll the dice, you don't want to start being detached because it's a big mountain to climb.'", "summary": "Christian Benteke netted all three as Aston Villa drew 3-3 against QPR.

Gareth Huw Davies enjoys the new stability on the teardrop-shaped island in the Indian Ocean, where the holiday industry is recovering, and expanding with a crop of smart new hotels, after the dual torment of a tsunami and a bitter civil war. The modern Seema Malaka temple, Colombo, Sri Lanka. The temple floats on Colombo's Beira Lake. 1...Pure serendipity. This is the spiritual home of serendipity \u2013 lucky discoveries by accident \u2013 as Serendib is the island\u2019s ancient name. It happens everywhere. On one of my early starts for an excursion, serendipity was seeing dozens of candles flickering in the dense dark outside a Buddhist temple. Then a schoolgirl in brilliant white uniform striding through the dawn mists along a levee between paddy fields, while an equally white egret paced daintily in the water. Or an old lady, knee-deep in a swamp picking blue water lilies, the national flower. And everywhere, games of impromptu cricket, with a stick for a bat and a plastic drum for a wicket, on bare mud patches, in gardens, on roads. Bath time! A frolicking elephant at the Uda Walawe nature reserve has around 200 of the giant creatures. 2...Jumbo jaunt. The island\u2019s unique subspecies of elephants are a vestige of ancient Sri Lanka. You can\u2019t miss them. My most memorable jumbo encounter was at the Uda Walawe nature reserve. We watched in awe as an extended family ambled across our track. One juvenile pushed over a tree, just for fun, it seemed. Last across was a harassed young mother, sheltering a three-week-old baby. In the right season you might see 200 elephants at the lake in Minneriya National Park. The distinguished star in Yala National Park is the \u2018prince of the night\u2019 \u2013 the leopard. Picture perfect! A tea Planatation near Hunas Falls near Kandy Sri Lanka. 3...Old England. The nearest thing to cool in Sri Lanka is its green and hilly heart, where tea plantations are a fascinating sight. Kandy, where the British beat the last king of Ceylon in 1815, still feels like a charming, antique outpost of empire. It is dotted with guesthouses that recall Tunbridge Wells. The colonial throwbacks include a bus station clock that chimes like Big Ben. There are red King George V post boxes and immaculate old Morris Minors, Hillman Minxes and Ford Anglias. I stayed at the Queen\u2019s Hotel, all echoing wooden corridors and wide, polished staircases. In the Botanical Gardens, I found the tree that Queen Elizabeth planted. In the serenity of the Temple of the Tooth, what is said to be the Buddha\u2019s tooth is kept safe within the innermost of seven caskets. Sigiriya is an ancient palace located in the central Matale District near the town of Dambulla in the Central Province. The name refers to a site that hosues a massive column of rock nearly 660 ft high. 4...Rock of ages. Sigiriya is a quarter the size of Ayers Rock, topped with the 1,500-year-old fortress of the playboy King Kasyapa. He killed his father and surrounded himself with a crocodile-filled moat to exclude his vengeful brother. I decided against the one-hour, 900ft climb to the top for the ancient frescoes and spicy graffiti. Instead I strolled into the jungle that smothers the massive defensive stones at the rock\u2019s base. Huge, golden-green butterflies fluttered past. A strange symphony of birds burbled out of the trees \u2013 Sri Lanka has many wonderful avian species. In a gap in the canopy I caught a flash of orange at the top of the rock. It was a Buddhist monk in his vivid garb. Yet more serendipity. Not the usual black cab: Taxi rank of tuk-tuks line the streets in Negombo in Sri Lanka. 5...TAKE THE TUK-TUK. Most visitors stay on the west and south coasts where, as well as standard tourist hotels, there is a growing choice of chic, small places such as Tri, a ten-suite boutique hotel near the south coast that opens in June. Then you can book trips by coach or car (with your own private driver) to most parts of Sri Lanka. For short distances the ubiquitous motorised tuk-tuks are fun. Don\u2019t even consider hiring a car. Roads are an all-day adrenaline rush. You need an expert at the wheel to dodge the massive Ashok Leyland Tusker lorries painted with idealised landscapes, jam-packed buses and wobbling bikes with impossible loads. Paradise! A golden beach with turquise waters at Unawatuna near Galle on the south coast of Sri Lanka. 6...JUST THE (TRAIN) TICKET. The little station on the Colombo to Galle line close by my hotel felt like a slumbering country halt from 1950s Britain. Behind the ticket office\u2019s narrow arched window, a clerk consulted his tomes and solemnly outlined my choices \u2013 I opted for a 90-minute trip in second class for 50p. On the platform I joined goats and men there just for a chat. We lurched off down the tragic (it bore the brunt of the 2004 tsunami) and beautiful coast to Galle. Another epic rail journey is Colombo to Trincomalee, the east coast city closed to the world by civil war until recently and still to be discovered by tourism. It\u2019s just \u00a32 one way.

Some of the touching items were from the graves of babies, while others were from the gravestone of a grandmother who fought a courageous battle against cancer. Sean Jefferson, 45, and Elizabeth Jowitt, 37, (pictured outside court) admitted handling stolen goods at York Magistrates' Court after decorating their flat in items such as lanterns, wreaths, trinkets and homemade gifts. The couple's actions were eventually discovered when a relative of one of the victims noticed a heart-shaped wreath which was meant for her mother hanging in their home. She contacted police and a raid found further items such as love heart ornaments, rosary beads and homemade gifts being used as decorations. Jefferson and Jowitt\u00a0pleaded guilty to two counts of handling stolen goods when they appeared at York Magistrates' Court this week. Jowitt had told police that someone had sold her the items which she wanted for 'decoration'. The couple escaped a prison sentence but were given a 47-week curfew and a restraining order banning them from cemeteries in the York area indefinitely. Kia Carlton, 26, said she had already felt suicidal after her daughter Telan died in her cot when she was just 11-months-old and said the disappearance of items from her daughter's grave was 'distressing'. Many of the items which vanished were homemade toys made by Telan's six-year-old brother Taran. In a victim impact statement read to the court, she said: 'I could not believe someone could stoop so low.' It was Angela Ryan who reported Jefferson and Jowitt to police, after she noticed items going missing from her mother Jennifer's grave. While on her way to work she spotted a wreath she believed to have been left for mother hanging in the window of the couple's flat. Items were taken from the grave of Telan Carlton (left) who died in her cot aged 11 months. Her mother Kia Stone said she had found it 'very distressing' that items, some homemade gifts, had gone from the grave. Other items vanished from Jennifer Ryan's grave, a charity fundraiser who passed away from cancer in 2013. Jennifer's husband Matthew, a retired fork-lift truck driver, said in his statement that his wife had died after 'a long and brave struggle with cancer' in November 2013. The 61-year-old said: 'I was sickened to my stomach to find someone could be so heartless. 'My wife had been so much of a fighter so to hear that she could not even rest in peace was so cruel. 'I can't believe there are people out there so heartless and cruel.' Sentencing the couple, presiding magistrate JP Penny Curry said: 'We have read and taken on board the harrowing accounts from families devastated by the desecration of plots and the removal of items of great sentimental value found in the possession of both defendants.' She also condemned their 'mean and despicable crime' which she said has had a 'devastating effect'. As well as a curfew and indefinite ban from graveyards, the magistrate ordered the couple to each pay \u00a3340 court costs and a \u00a360 surcharge. When Jefferson started muttering complaints from the dock about the terms of the banning order, the magistrate responded: 'No 'ifs' and 'buts'.
