[{"text": "Tulip has been covering the outbreak over the past few months, reporting on the children born with microcephaly and other birth defects believed to be caused by the virus as well as speaking to scientists who are leading the fight back against Zika. Many of you got in touch on Facebook to ask Tulip questions about the new vaccine, and when it might be available to pregnant women. This is an edited version of the Facebook Q&A. Question from Dawn McLean: Have you tested the vaccine already? How do you know if it works or not? Tulip answers: Human trials haven't started for the vaccine being developed by the National Institutes of Health - where I have been reporting from this week. They are due to start - assuming no major problems - in the summer/ autumn of this year. If the vaccine is found to be safe with no concerning side effects, the drug will be given to a larger number of people to test how effective it is and further evaluate its safety. The final phase is giving it to large groups of people to confirm how effective it is. Question from Priscilla Wakanuma: How possible is it to make a vaccine for this virus? Tulip replies: Scientists here in Bethesda at the National Institutes of Health think it's very possible. They already have a vaccine for a similar virus - West Nile - which they have been working on. So they're using some of the tried and tested methods from that to try and develop a vaccine for Zika ASAP. Taj Rahman asks: The vaccine is available in November, I thought this was a global emergency? Tulip replies: Hi Taj - getting vaccines ready for market takes years, often decades. They have to go through stringent safety and efficacy trials and then get signed off by a whole load of regulatory bodies. When the WHO declared this public health emergency last month, one of the key things they highlighted was the urgent need for research into new vaccines. Scientists and pharmaceuticals came together very fast on Ebola, it's hoped that can happen again this time. But sadly, many more babies are expected to be born with these birth defects in the meantime. Question from Hannah Borrett: How have they managed to push through the development so quickly? Tulip replies: You're right, it can take years, decades even to get a new vaccine through all the clinical trials and then signed off through all the various national and international regulatory authorities. But in an emergency - which the Zika outbreak now is - things can be fast-tracked. A lot more money is put into research, and there's a much bigger political will to get things moving fast. Take the Ebola outbreak for example, there are now a couple of candidate vaccines that could be used in an outbreak that have shown some efficacy. Research - and cash - for that vaccine was pushed through super quickly. Adebola Misturah Martins-Bello asks about plans to prioritise who will be considered a priority for the vaccine. Tulip replies: The plan here at the National Institutes of Health is to have a special focus on protecting pregnant women. The virus isn't particularly harmful for most people, but the concern is this strongly suspected link to babies of infected mothers being born with under developed brains. If a link if confirmed, and a vaccine is developed quickly - health authorities will look into whether to add it to childhood vaccines, a bit like the rubella vaccine, which also protects girls/ women if they have babies later in life.

Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled \u00a34.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further \u00a3500m in cash terms this year, it said. \"Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional \u00a31.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,\" the report warned. It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. \"What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,\" ADASS president Ray James said. \"In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing.\" ADASS called for the government to \"protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community\". But a government spokesman said the survey \"ignores\" a commitment to invest \u00a310bn in health services that are being \"joined up\" with social care, by 2020. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The \"care calculator\" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: \"Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money.\" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing \"enormous pressures\" due to \"insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs\". \"We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. \"It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,\" she added. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the idea of a further \u00a31bn coming out of social care budgets was \"chilling\". Sue Brown, vice chairman of the Care and Support Alliance - which represents 80 leading charities - said the figures \"confirm what we already know - that the care system is in worsening crisis\". She said \"chronic underfunding\" of adult social care had seen \"dramatic year-on-year rationing of support, excluding hundreds of thousands of older and disabled people from the care they desperately need\". Janet Morrison, chief executive of the charity Independent Age, said: \"This worrying survey shows how the frail and elderly in our society are being hit by year on year cutbacks to council services.\" \"It's vital now more than ever that we have an honest debate about the true costs of providing social care, not just health care,\" she added.", "summary": "Adult social care firms are struggling to hire, retain and train staff as a result of cuts to council budgets, a survey of senior officials suggests."}, {"text": "Rashan Charles, 20, was wrestled to the ground in Dalston, east London, on 22 July, and died about an hour later. On Friday, clashes broke out in Hackney as protesters blocked part of Kingsland Road and set mattresses alight. A spokesman for Mr Charles's family said they understood the anger but called for \"dignified\" protest. \"Burning down homes will not give justice,\" he said. Mr Charles was pursued by officers and became ill after trying to swallow an object, the Met has said. He died soon after in hospital. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating. Police warned that anyone using Mr Charles's death \"as an excuse to commit crime\" would be \"dealt with robustly\". Appealing for calm, family spokesman Stafford Scott said: \"We understand your frustration, we understand your anger - don't feel that the family doesn't feel the anger and the frustration too. \"But what the family knows is taking it to the streets doesn't give you justice. \"Burning down your own homes, burning down your neighbourhood is not going to give you justice.\" Mr Scott, who runs race advocacy group Tottenham Rights, said black people had historically found it difficult \"to win the hearts and minds of people\". \"We get no empathy, we get no sympathy. But this case is different - for once we've got the evidence. \"For once we're not relying on the IPCC or the police to gather the evidence. The world has seen it and will feel it if we don't get justice.\" He added the family needed to \"fight this properly\" and had sought the best legal support. Mr Scott said the family asked the community \"to support them in their struggle, to be dignified when they expect us to be wild\". Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP Diane Abbott told the protest she supported Mr Charles's parents and would not rest until questions were answered. In an earlier statement, the shadow home secretary said: \"The anger and upset at the death of Rashan Charles is understandable. \"But Rashan's family have explicitly spoken out against hostile actions. We must respect their wishes and any protests must be peaceful.\" The anger of the protesters is clear. Many chanted \"Justice for Rashan\", clutching pictures of him along with their placards. Some confronted the police officers there to keep an eye on the demonstration, demanding answers. There were none forthcoming. That's because the investigation is now in the hands of the Independent Police Complaints Commission. It will be their job to determine exactly what happened. Some campaigners, though, say there are too many of these investigations, too many lives being lost. They feel that their voices are too often not heard. There was much talk of the CCTV footage that captured the moment Rashan Charles was restrained. That has been pored over frame by frame, with many different interpretations of what happened, and many questions raised by it. Despite the anger, the vigil passed off peacefully, but the campaigners say they will not be silenced. They left though with the words of the family ringing in their ears: \"We want peace on the streets.\" On Friday evening, demonstrators blocked part of Kingsland Road. At one point protesters, some wearing masks, jumped on to a lorry and clung to the wing mirrors as it drove through the barricade. Scores of missiles were later launched at police as they attempted to disperse the group. Police in Hackney tweeted: \"Officers have been subjected to abuse and violence. Whatever the frustrations, this is patently not what the family of Rashan Charles wanted.\" The Met Police has since said that the violence that erupted on Friday night was \"separate\" from a peaceful protest that was held earlier in the day. Det Supt Claire Crawley said: \"Thankfully nobody was seriously injured, but there was inconvenience to local residents and road users and damage caused to vehicles, a cash machine and a number of windows. \"We will always support the right to lawful protest but behaviour such as that seen last night cannot be tolerated.\"", "summary": "The family of a black man who died after being apprehended by police has appealed for peace after violent protests in the wake of his death."}, {"text": "At the Paris climate summit last December, governments agreed that they would \"pursue efforts\" to keep warming below this figure. But a new study shows the limit will be breached over land, even if emissions of warming gases ceased immediately. The research has been published in the journal Scientific Reports. Around 180 countries have so far signed the Paris climate agreement in which they pledged not only to limit the global temperature rise since pre-industrial times to \"well below\" 2C but to do their very best to keep them to 1.5C. The lower target was crucial in gaining the support of small island states and the poorest developing countries. Rallying around the slogan, \"1.5 to stay alive,\" they have argued their very survival is at stake with the rise in sea levels and the increase in storms that this amount of warming would bring. But as recorded temperatures this year have edged above 1C, scientists believe we are already \"dancing\" with the 1.5 degree target. This new study suggests that it will \"almost certainly be surpassed\", at least over land, based on the amount of CO2 already in the atmosphere. \"Even if we just had a planet where we could prevent greenhouse gases going up any further, there would be an additional warming over land, in many places if not most it would 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels,\" said lead author Dr Chris Huntingford from the UK's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. The researchers say there are two reasons behind the finding. The first is the fact that much of the heat created in the Earth's greenhouse is currently subsumed into the oceans. The authors argue that this sea sink will decline as the world cuts emissions of CO2 and other warming gases, putting more heat into the air. This will combine with the second reason, namely that warming rates over land are far higher than those over the oceans. \"At the moment the oceans are drawing down a vast amount of heat from the atmosphere,\" said Dr Huntingford, \"but as you stabilise the climate you get to the position where these net fluxes of heat actually become zero, and that would correspond to a higher temperature.\" Other researchers agree that keeping temperatures at the 1.5 figure is going to be a significant, if not impossible, challenge. \"In my opinion we should work for as low a target as possible,\" said Dr Gavin Schmidt from Nasa, who was not involved with the study. \"But we should be prepared for worse.\" The authors of the latest paper say that it was a good idea to have an \"aspirational\" 1.5 degree target in the Paris agreement. Emissions are going down they say and the uptake of renewable and green sources of energy is happening more quickly than expected. But if the world is to take the 1.5 target seriously, then a serious discussion needs to be held about the implications of that goal. \"I think there needs to be a very thoughtful debate about what's to be gained at these different temperature levels, if approaching the lower levels meant severely damaging the economy,\" said Dr Huntingford. \"Every climate scientist realises that when you write that we have to get emissions down to hit this target that could potentially push the world into a global recession - so we need to be really clear about what's to be gained by aiming for 1.5 that might be extremely difficult for society rather than 2 degrees.\" Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc and on Facebook.", "summary": "Scientists are calling for a \"thoughtful debate\" about the wisdom of attempts to keep a global rise in temperatures under 1.5C."}, {"text": "Sir Timothy O'Shea said plans to elect the chair of universities' governing bodies were \"inconsistent, incoherent and potentially very damaging\". The proposal is made in the Scottish government's Higher Education Governance Bill. The Scottish government said it would continue to listen to all views. The bill aims to improve the way universities - which are fiercely protective of their independence from the state - are governed. Although universities get a large chunk of their income from the Scottish government, unlike schools and colleges they are not part of the public sector or directly accountable to politicians. The proposal which has caused the most controversy is for directly elected chairs for university courts - students and staff would be able to take part in the vote. But this is seen by some as a threat to the role of the rector at the ancient universities. The role of the rector is sometimes seen as purely symbolic and ceremonial. However, supporters argue the best rectors can be powerful ambassadors for their universities and champions of the students' interests. Prof Sir Timothy said amendments to the bill could prove damaging to his university. He said the amendments would allow for two elected positions playing a chairing role in the university - a rector and a senior lay member. This would suggest changing what he described as the \"the long-established and well-understood role of our rector - without any prior consultation or discussion.\" He also argued the senior lay member would appear to have significantly weaker powers than their counterparts at other universities - without any prior consultation. Sir Timothy said: \"The amendments are inconsistent, incoherent and potentially very damaging for one of Scotland's major universities. \"There has been no consultation or discussion with us, or the wider sector on the implications, which require careful consultation and scrutiny otherwise there is a real risk of perverse and possibly unintended consequences.\" He argued it could even significantly impede the university's ability to contribute to the economic and social good of the country. He urged Holyrood's education committee to ask the government to withdraw these amendments until they have consulted with those affected on the implications of their proposals. However, Sir Timothy also welcomed amendments to the bill, including one which removed some additional ministerial powers that he argued threatened the university's institutional autonomy. A Scottish government spokesperson said: \"The Higher Education Governance Bill aims to ensure that the entire campus community has a say on how our higher education institutions are governed. \"We have worked closely with the sector over the course of the bill's development and will continue to listen to the views of all interested parties and consider all constructive suggestions as the bill continues to be considered by parliament. \"The detail of how a rector and new elected senior lay member would work together would remain, as now, a matter for each autonomous institution to address. The bill does not change that.\" The Scottish government said any expansion in the role of the rector in a higher education institution beyond the current role set out in statute would be a matter for each institution. \"We think that the post of senior lay member should be an elected one,\" the spokesperson said. \"This role is pivotal in the leadership of all Scottish institutions, and all staff and students should have their say in appointing the best candidate for the role. \"The model for appointment of the senior lay member proposed by the Scottish Government has been discussed with stakeholders.\"", "summary": "Plans for changes in the way universities are governed are facing a fresh attack from the principal of Edinburgh University."}, {"text": "On Monday, Mr Robinson, who now advises the economy minister, denied any family links to the Renewable Heat Incentive. MLA Jonathan Bell said he was told he could not challenge the scheme because two DUP special advisers had \"extensive interests in the poultry industry\". Mr Bell made the allegation on Monday, speaking under parliamentary privilege. The DUP said the claims were \"outrageous\". But on Tuesday, Mr Robinson told the Press Association his father-in-law applied to the scheme in August 2015, before he was married in October. \"I have never had any personal financial interest in the RHI Scheme,\" he said in a statement. \"At no point have I ever advised anyone to join the Scheme or sought to benefit in any way from it. \"Neither my wife nor I have ever had any role in the business nor have we received any benefit, financial or otherwise, from the business. \"I was appointed as an adviser in the Department for the Economy in June 2016. I was not involved in any aspect of the RHI Scheme prior to taking up the post.\" The other adviser named by Mr Bell, Timothy Johnston, also denied his claims. MLAs were debating the RHI scheme at Stormont. The RHI scheme was set up by former first minister Arlene Foster in 2012 when she was enterprise minister. Its aim was to increase consumption of heat from renewable sources. However, businesses received more in subsidies than they paid for fuel, and the scheme became heavily oversubscribed. It could lead to an overspend of \u00c2\u00a3490m over the next 20 years. Mr Bell said when he was enterprise minister his special adviser, Timothy Cairns, told him \"he will not be allowed to reduce the tariff on (the RHI) scheme\" because of Mr Johnston and Mr Robinson's \"extensive interests in the poultry industry\". He added that he has \"kept the records in many, many formats\" and that he had been suspended from the party for \"telling the truth\". He also claimed that Mr Robinson and Dr Andrew Crawford, a DUP party adviser, had issued instructions to \"try not to get Arlene called to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC)\" and \"under no circumstance allow Jonathan Bell to be called\" over their roles in the RHI scheme. On Monday the DUP said that neither Mr Johnston nor Mr Robinson have interests in the poultry industry, and added that Mr Robinson's \"family home farm have chicken houses but are not part of the RHI scheme and never have been recipients or applicants\". Mr Johnston, the special adviser to Arlene Foster when she was first minister, said: \"I have no family connections to the poultry industry and I have no connection to the RHI scheme. \"These are unsubstantiated allegations. I have two brothers-in-law in the poultry industry. They have no connection to RHI.\" Mr Robinson, special adviser to Economy Minister Simon Hamilton, said: \"I have no personal interest in the poultry industry. Two of my brothers are poultry farmers but they have no connections to RHI.\" Dr Crawford, a former special adviser to the Department of Finance, told the BBC last month that his brother is the director of a company which successfully applied to the RHI scheme. He said: \"I never sought to keep the RHI scheme open at the original higher tariff against the wishes of the minister.\" Mr Bell broke ranks with his party and made serious allegations against the DUP over the scheme's operation in a BBC interview in December.

The story of his life is very much the story of our times: revolutionary movements, the Cold War, East v West, North v South, communism v capitalism - except that most of the world has passed him by. Fidel Castro has remained the same, a symbol of revolution, a communist who has survived the fall of communism. Before surgery took him out of public view in July 2006, he inspired his followers with slogans and five-hour speeches. Fidel's views continued to be made public though in the form of editorials and occasional TV appearances. Fidel maintained his rule with an iron grip, sending opponents to prison for years. Throughout his leadership, he railed against the US, its economic and trade embargo and against the evils of free markets Fidel has been praised for standing up for the oppressed of Latin America, for opposing the Yankee imperialist, for making Cuba into a more equal society than many, for developing Cuba's health service and sending doctors abroad to help others. And it wasn't only doctors he sent abroad. He despatched troops to Angola and Ethiopia in support of fellow revolutionaries. His hand was seen in many a revolutionary movement in his own continent. But he has also been condemned for intolerance, for keeping his people poor and for refusing to see the benefits of economic liberalisation that even the communists of China have embraced. Fidel Castro stopped his people from leaving the island, leading them to risk their lives in rickety boats to try to get out. At one stage in the early years of the Reagan administration he was accused of trying to take over Central America for the Soviet Union by revolution. Washington at that time saw a path that led from the guerrillas of El Salvador through Nicaragua to Cuba and right up to the door of the Kremlin. Cuban assistance to the small and then revolutionary island of Grenada in the Caribbean prompted a full-scale US invasion. Throughout his rule, President Castro remained in almost permanent confrontation with the United States - and it with him. The American embargo on Cuba has been used by both sides - as a policy by the US to isolate Cuba and as an excuse by Fidel Castro for the island's poverty. US President Barack Obama and Castro's successor as president, younger brother Raul, announced a thawing in relations in 2015 but the embargo remains in place. When Mr Obama visited earlier this year - the first by a US leader in more than half a century - Castro remained defiant, saying Cuba did not need any gifts from the \"empire\" in a damning letter. He cut a giant figure on the world stage during the 47 years he controlled Cuba - at one point bringing the US and the Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war. It was the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 that propelled him into worldwide prominence. Before that he had been just a glamorous revolutionary leader. He had overthrown the dictator Batista in a classic guerrilla war and had fought off an American-led invasion by Cuban exiles on the Bay of Pigs in 1961. But when Nikita Khrushchev decided, with Fidel Castro's agreement, to station nuclear missiles in Cuba itself, the island leader turned from being a thorn in the side of the Americans into being a mortal threat. It was only the skilled diplomacy of Jack Kennedy (and of Khrushchev in the end) that saved the day, and Fidel's own island from destruction. The then-US defence Secretary Robert McNamara met President Castro in 1992. He said the Cuban leader told him there were 162 nuclear missiles in Cuba at the time of the crisis. He asked Castro if he had recommended they be used. The answer was: \"Yes, I did.\" \"And what would have happened to Cuba?\" Mr McNamara asked him. \"It would have been destroyed.\" Fidel Castro was not part of the diplomacy that ended the missile crisis. But he came out of the crisis remarkably strengthened. Kennedy promised that the US would not invade Cuba, a promise that has held. The CIA made efforts to get rid of him with bizarre plots involving the Mafia and poison. They came to nothing. President Castro's people took immense precautions to protect him from potential harm from food and drink, as diplomats who invite him to their receptions in Havana found out.

Meanwhile, the independent Hong Kong press feel the trial ended up becoming the disgraced politician's \"individual show\". \"Unexpectedly, Bo Xilai retracted his testimony in court, and his rebuttal left the prosecution speechless.

Lesley Graham is one of four women who, along with charity Breast Cancer Now, have launched a petition for it to be approved. She told BBC Scotland it offered women like her \"a little glimmer of hope\". Kadcyla is used to treat a specific type of tumour - HER2-positive - when breast cancer spreads to other parts of the body. Currently, it is not approved for use on the NHS in Scotland. The SMC is due to reconsider that this week, with its decision to be announced next month. Last year Ms Graham, a 39-year-old mother of two from Barrhead, wrote to health secretary Shona Robison after being denied the treatment. She was later granted it after a second appeal. Along with three other woman - Lesley Stephen, Alison Tait and Anne MacLean-Chang - she has been calling for it to be made available automatically on the NHS. Their petition, backed by the Daily Record newspaper, now has more than 13,000 signatures. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Kaye Adams programme, she said: \"If there's something out there that can help people, then it needs to be made available. \"The repercussions of someone losing their mum or their daughter are widespread. It has a rippling affect. Everyone deserves a chance at life and every child deserves a mum.\" She added: \"To be told that you have cancer and your life is therefore limited because of that is devastating enough. \"But to then be told there is something that can potentially buy you some time or keep you well for longer, but you can't have it, seems to me barbaric.\" She described living with an incurable cancer as like \"swallowing a hand-grenade and not knowing when it is going to go off\". \"This treatment offers a little glimmer of hope that it will buy us time and offers hope that in the meantime maybe someone can come up with something that will keep us here in addition to that,\" Ms Graham said. Breast Cancer Now said there were about 118 women in Scotland who \"could benefit from this drug if it was approved tomorrow\".

Launching UKIP's campaign poster on immigration, Mr Farage said an \"honest debate\" on the subject was needed to restore public trust in politics. The Conservatives said UKIP's immigration policy was in \"chaos\". Speaking in Dover, Mr Farage told the gathered media that the other parties were making false promises on immigration during the election campaign. But he said the only solution to controlling immigration was to leave the EU - which UKIP campaigns for. The prime minister pledged in 2011 to reduce the number of migrants coming to the UK to levels last seen in the 1990s, about \"tens of thousands\" each year. But the target has not been met, with the latest figures showing net migration rose to 298,000 for the year ending in September 2014 - higher than when he came to office. Nigel Farage swept in and out of a blustery press call in the shadow of the white cliffs of Dover. The UKIP leader - helped along by a backdrop of party activists - unveiled a poster attacking the Conservatives' record on immigration, in response to which they said UKIP's policy was in \"chaos\". An initially well-behaved press pack soon descended into a gentle scrum, with Mr Farage directed towards one camera then another for a series of interviews. He announced new target immigration figures, was challenged over his views on migrants with long-term illnesses and set an ambitious timeframe to get immigration down. Then, time for a coffee - not a pint - in a local pub before Mr Farage was whisked away again. A picturesque media opportunity, but one that revealed little more about UKIP's immigration policy other than the obvious fact it is central to their campaign. The symbolic location, with the shadow of France on the horizon, was deliberately chosen by Team UKIP to keep Britain's relationship with the continent at the forefront of people's minds. Although - perhaps ironically - it also caused some mobile phones to switch to French networks in order to function. Downing Street said the rise has been driven in part by Britain's economic success relative to its neighbours in the eurozone. Labour said the government's pledge was \"in tatters\". But, unveiling UKIP's campaign advert, Mr Farage said: \"When Cameron made that promise he was being wilfully dishonest. \"Because he knew the truth and I think now the British public, five years on, know the truth: that you actually cannot have an immigration policy, you can't set targets of any kind at all, you can't attempt to control who comes into Britain all the while you're members of the European Union.\" He issued a call for a \"return to normality\", saying net immigration - the difference between the number of people leaving the UK and the number coming in - should be brought down to about 30,000 people per year. Charlie Elphicke, Conservative candidate in Dover, accused Mr Farage's party of performing U-turns on immigration policy. \"All we've seen from UKIP on immigration is chaos and confusion: one minute there's a cap, then there's not. Mark Reckless says certain migrants should be repatriated, then Farage says they're welcome to stay,\" he said. I am not sure if it is by design or if he just wants a slow start, but two days in to this general election campaign and UKIP leader Nigel Farage appears to be taking it easy. Or at least that is how it seems. This is a candidate who has to win on 7 May. If he fails to become the next MP for South Thanet he has said he will quit as leader. Yet I have seen no door-knocking.

David Cameron has promised to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership of the EU and put it to a public vote in 2017, if the Conservatives win in May. Labour has said it does not support an in/out referendum, while Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said his party would not \"play footsie\" with the idea of leaving the EU - although he has refused to say he would block a referendum as part of any coalition deal. The Financial Times has reported the Lib Dems would only agree to support a poll if the franchise was extended to EU migrants resident in the UK and 16- and 17-year-olds. The party is also said to want to have a say on the wording of the question and the timing of the vote. In response, UKIP's economic spokesman and campaign chief Patrick O'Flynn accused Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg of preparing to \"rig\" a referendum if they are in power together again. He said it would be \"profoundly unfair\" to allow UK-based EU nationals to participate, and claimed the idea to give younger people a vote was designed to sway the result towards an \"in\" vote.", "summary": "David Cameron was \"wilfully dishonest\" when he pledged to cap immigration to the tens of thousands, UKIP leader Nigel Farage has said."}, {"text": "Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change. \u201cHave you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?\u201d shouted a producer in London. \u201cIf not, why not?\u201d This appeared to be an impossible demand. Steve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle. Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple\u2019s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone. He graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O\u2019Clock News piece. The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were \u201ca fragment of the true cross\u201d, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch. I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we\u2019d had a TV news bulletin back then. Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership? But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade, putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries. One example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It\u2019s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage. Compare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer. This 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days. My point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move. Of course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn\u2019t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text. So, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history.

Patients are being left without sufficient pain relief and respite. NHS England said it was committed to ensuring terminally-ill patients got the support and services they needed. The report found inequalities in access to good care, with certain groups of patients more likely to miss out. With an ageing population and demand for care increasing, the problem looked set to worsen, it warned. Those who currently miss out include: Most palliative care goes to cancer patients, even though the diseases account for less than a third of deaths. Only a fifth of new referrals to specialist end-of-life services are for people with non-cancer diagnoses. According to the report, commissioned by the Marie Curie charity, providing palliative care to those that need it could improve the quality of life for thousands of patients and save the NHS money by preventing unwanted and distressing hospital treatment. By their calculations, the net potential savings are more than \u00a330m in England, at least \u00a32m in Wales, more than \u00a31m in Northern Ireland and more than \u00a34m in Scotland.

A district nurse would visit once a week, but Mr McKnight said this was nowhere near enough to meet their care needs. He said: \"I felt alone. I felt almost abandoned, except for my family. \"Palliative care as it is provided by the nursing system is the best that they can possibly do. Most nurses would want to do the very best job possible.

The Lib Dems also said Labour's figures - obtained through a parliamentary question - were out of date. Mr Burnham announced the analysis as his party unveiled a new poster, which reworks the Conservatives' \"Labour isn't working\" image of 1979 by depicting a huge queue outside a waiting room with the title: \"The doctor can't see you now.\" Mr Burnham said: \"Today, across the country, people will face the frustration of joining a queue to see their GP - in some places the lines will go out of the surgery door. After five years of David Cameron, patients at hundreds of surgeries can no longer get a GP appointment when they need one.\" In other election developments: This issue includes NHS funding, GP access and social care, particularly of older people. Policy guide: Where the parties stand Labour has pledged \u00a32.5bn to pay for 8,000 more GPs, guaranteeing appointments within 48 hours.

The Commons answer suggested the coalition had reduced extended access funding in England from \u00a33.01 per patient to \u00a31.90 per patient, meaning that - by 2013/14 - 72% of surgeries offered extended hours under the scheme, a reduction of 590, according to Labour's interpretation. But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Labour's figures were wrong, because they did not take into account the Prime Minister's Challenge Fund, which covers 1,100 practices and helps 7.5 million patients see a GP in the evenings and at weekends. \"We are extending this scheme to cover over 1,400 additional practices, helping 10 million extra people by this time next year,\" he said, adding that a Conservative government would deliver \"a truly seven-day NHS\". Pilot schemes paid for by this fund include those testing approaches such as the use of technology, health apps, and allowing access to services by video call, email or telephone. Mr Hunt blamed Labour's \"disastrous\" renegotiation of the NHS contract for GPs in 2004 for creating the problem, which Conservatives say \"meant 90% of GPs stopped giving out-of-hours care\". The Lib Dems also pointed to a \u00a350m GP Access Fund, which they say helped 1,147 practices to extend their hours last year. Party election spokesman Lord Scriven said: \"The Liberal Democrats are the only party prepared to commit to spending the \u00a38bn extra the NHS says it needs to survive.\" Meanwhile, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg has been setting out how a crackdown on tax dodgers - and increased tax on shareholders' dividend payments - would fund a rise in the personal allowance to \u00a312,500. The party wants to increase the point at which people start paying income tax to \u00a311,000 next year, then to \u00a312,500 by 2020. Having spent much of Monday battling the Conservatives to claim credit for the increase in the threshold to \u00a310,600 that had come in overnight, Mr Clegg continued his attack on his former coalition partners. \"The Liberal Democrats have got a plan to give further tax cuts to people on low and middle incomes by asking a little bit more from the wealthiest,\" he said. \"The Conservatives... want to give tax cuts to the wealthiest by taking from the poorest. That's the difference and that's the choice which people have got when it comes to tax cuts at this election.\" Increasing the personal allowance to \u00a311,000 would give 27 million people an \u00a380 tax cut and take 376,000 people out of tax altogether, including 157,000 pensioners.

In Kensington and Chelsea, only 59% got their first preference, while in Barking and Dagenham it was 91%. This comes against a backdrop of an extra 900 applications in the capital this year. The crisis has been precipitated mainly by a booming birth-rate, partly by immigration and by families moving specifically to be near popular schools. The demand for school places has risen steeply in Harrow, which has some very good primary schools. It was predicted to be 12% over capacity by this September but the council said it had worked really hard to ensure there are enough places for Harrow children this year.

Figures from East Sussex show 84.68% got their first choice, while in Southampton the percentage was 85.4%. In Derbyshire, 93.4% of youngsters received their first pick, in Torbay it was 86.2%, Bristol was 84% - up from 82% last year, and in Cornwall it was 90.7%. In Kent the figure was was 85.81%, up slightly from 84.9% last year. Labour and the National Association of Head Teachers also blame the coalition government's free-school policy, which has allowed some new schools to be opened in areas that already have surplus places. At the same time, the ability of local authorities to plan for population surges has been reduced by regulations requiring any new schools to be either an academy or a free school, rather than a council school. NAHT general secretary Russell Hobby said: \"We have a balkanised system with authorities, academies and central government taking decisions in isolation.\" He added: \"There is a desperate need for long-term planning that spans all sectors. With the massive increase in pupil numbers and over-stretched budgets, we cannot afford inefficiency and conflict.\" The Local Government Association said the escalating places shortage was one of the key areas that needed to be tackled by the next government. Earlier this month, it said schools were \"reaching their limits and could soon run out of space and money for extra places\" and there would be a need for an extra 880,000 pupils at a cost of \u00c2\u00a312bn. The Conservatives blame Labour for the problem saying the party \"cut over 200,000 primary school places - and even ignored official warnings to provide extra school places after a baby boom\". A spokesman added: \"The Conservatives have created over 400,000 school places. There are fewer children in overcrowded primary schools and, most importantly, one million more children in good or outstanding schools since 2010.\" Labour points out that under the Conservative-Lib Dem administration the number of infant children in classes with more than 30 pupils has more than trebled from 31,265 in 2010 to 102,615 in 2015. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt blamed the Conservatives for spending \"hundreds of millions of taxpayers' money on a few free schools in areas where there are no shortages of places\". But Natalie Evans, director of New Schools Network, said: \"Over 90% of primary free schools opened or approved to open are in areas where new school places are needed. But they are also offering new choices in areas of low standards.\" Liberal Democrat schools minister David Laws said: \"It's astonishing that Labour and the Conservatives won't properly fund these children. It will be impossible to provide a place for every child and raise standards unless we protect education budgets.\" Ty Goddard, co-founder of think-tank Education Foundation, said England's vast education property estate could be used with more imagination, but called for the parties to work together on solving the school places issue.

Workers at the charity claim investment in housing would be cheaper than jailing homeless repeat offenders. The Welsh Government said more people than ever were getting help to address housing problems. Changes to the Housing Act in Wales, introduced in 2015, removed the right for prison leavers to be given priority for accommodation. Prison Link Cymru, which helps people find accommodation after their release, said things were generally good for women because issues such as children or domestic violence were now considered. However, the same could not be said for men, the charity said, because issues which often affect them, such as post traumatic stress disorder or drug dependency, were often viewed as less of a priority. Andrew Stevens, who works in Welsh prisons trying to secure housing for prison leavers, said the need for accommodation was \"chronic\". \"There's a desperate need for it, finding suitable accommodation for those leaving prison there is just a lack of it everywhere,\" he said. \"It could take six months to a year, without a lot of help they could be on the streets for six months. \"When you think of the consequences of either being on the street, especially with the cold weather at the moment or you may have a roof over your head, sometimes there is only one choice.\" Mr Stevens believes building more one-bedroom flats could help ease the problem. \"The average price is a hundred pounds a week to keep someone in a rented flat, prison is a lot more than that so I would imagine it would save the public purse quite a few pounds,\" he said. Official figures show 830 one-bedroom properties were built in the year to March 2016, of an overall total of 6,900 new properties in Wales. Marc, 50, who has been in and out of prison for the past 20 years for burglary offences, said he struggled to find accommodation each time he was released. He said he would ask himself: \"Where am I going to stay? Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\" \"You're put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it's difficult, it's difficult to get away from it. It's like every man for himself, there's nothing.\" Marc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing. \"You feel safe, you got hot food, you've got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It's a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said. Tom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available. \"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven't got accommodation and haven't got provision,\" he said. \"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don't delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can't. \"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\" A Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence. It added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.", "summary": "There is a \"chronic\" need for more housing for prison leavers in Wales, according to a charity."}, {"text": "His firm, Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa, already owns the Three mobile network, and combining it with O2 would create the UK's biggest mobile group. However, the move could face tough scrutiny from competition regulators. It would reduce the number of major operators in the UK from four to three, which might not benefit consumers. Further consolidation within the telecommunications industry is already on the cards, with BT Group in talks to buy rival operator EE. If a deal is agreed it would have to be approved by competition regulators in Brussels. Currently the UK mobile market is dominated by O2, EE, Vodafone and Three. However, Hutchison Whampoa group finance director, Frank Sixt, pointed to deals in other countries, including Ireland, which were given the green light and which also reduced the number of competitors in the market from four to three. \"The European Commission has taken a positive view of four-to-three consolidations of mobile in three cases now...and we believe that the precedents that they have set in those transactions will apply for this transaction,\" he said. Mark Newman, chief research officer at telecoms consultancy, Ovum, thinks there may still be grounds for concern. \"The big question we should be asking ourselves is whether the consolidation will result in prices going up,\" he said. \"It's worth looking at the Austrian market which has gone from five operators a few years ago to three today. It appears as though prices have gone up in the Austrian market.\" O2 said in a statement: \"Three is known for campaigning on behalf of its customers, much like O2. \"We are confident that an agreement will mutually benefit the customers of both companies, as well as drive better value, quality and investment in one of the most digitally competitive countries in the world.\" These are turbulent times for the UK mobile phone industry - and for its customers. Just a few years back, there were five operators - Orange, T-Mobile, Vodafone, O2 and the scrappy outsider, Three. Now Three owner Li-Ka Shing's move for O2 means it is likely there will be three giants in charge of our phones and the prices we pay to use them. BT's move on EE, the merger of Orange and T-Mobile, appeared to raise few competition concerns because it won't cut the number of choices for consumers. Hutchison's plans are a different matter. Three has been a small player making a big impact by bold pricing moves such as offering free international roaming and unlimited data deals. But combined with O2 it would be the biggest operator, and might be keen to raise prices. The competition authorities in Brussels and in London seem certain to want to have a look at the deal, though some might argue that consolidation in Europe's most competitive mobile market is inevitable and will lead to more investment in better networks. One company which might be cheering the regulators on is Vodafone. It was already unhappy about the implications of any BT/EE deal - now what was the UK's global telecoms powerhouse faces being an also-ran in its home market. Hutchison said in a statement that the exclusive negotiations with Telefonica will take a period of several weeks. \"Shareholders and potential investors of the company should note that such negotiations may or may not result in any transaction, and accordingly are advised to exercise caution when dealing in the shares of the company,\" it said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.

But the manifesto stretches far beyond the initial nine point plan, with a huge document some 194 pages long. Plaid promises to save 10,000 lives between 2016 and 2026 through a range of measures, including action on public health actions and promoting individual lifestyle changes. They include ensuring earlier diagnosis of disease and better access to life-saving treatments. \"Overall we will reduce preventable deaths by 25% by 2026,\" the manifesto says. And in a major shake-up to how the NHS is run, Plaid says it will fully integrate primary, community and adult social care. It says it would create a \"National Network of Acute and Specialist Hospitals\", and consult on whether this will be run directly by the Welsh Government's Department of Health or by an arms-length NHS Board.

Timeline: Ten years of stop and start for NI's public services college The BBC revealed in March that a programme board in charge of the Desertcreat project had concluded it was no longer economically viable. It said the joint college as originally planned was no longer needed because of reduction in the number of training days required by each of the three services. The Office of First and deputy First Minister then asked for a revised business case, setting out preferred options for future training needs. That review has now been completed and the BBC has obtained a copy of a draft report setting out the board's recommendations. It says the preferred option is for the fire service to have a training facility at Desertcreat at an estimated cost of \u00a344m. If the plan is approved by the Northern Ireland Executive, it is understood the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) would also be allocated about \u00a320m to refurbish its existing training facilities at Garnerville police station in east Belfast. The Northern Ireland Prison Service would be given funding for training at Maghaberry and Magilligan prisons as its training centre in Millisle, County Down, has been closed. The proposed new complex for the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) would be built on the site bought 10 years ago for a new policing college at Desertcreat. That plan was later changed to include the fire and prison services, but has now been revised. It would include what is called a 'hot house'. This is a building that can be set on fire in a controlled fashion, or heated to extremely high temperatures, to give firefighters realistic training. Northern Ireland does not currently have such a facility. The NIFRS would like it to have different sections to replicate the different conditions and challenges involved when tackling a blaze in domestic homes, commercial premises and high-rise buildings. The money for all of the training facilities would have to be provided by the executive. That is because a \u00a353m funding package from the Treasury was withdrawn earlier this year due to a failure to build the proposed joint college within a stipulated timeframe.

Will have a big effect on presidential election!\" The previous day, during a joint press conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, Mr Trump had quickly labelled the incident a \"terrorist attack\" - before even French authorities had done so. \"It's a very, very terrible thing that is going on in the world today,\" Mr Trump said. \"And what can you say? It just never ends. We have to be strong and we have to be vigilant, and I've been saying it for a long time.\" That last line is certainly true. While the dynamics of French politics are decidedly different from those in the US, Mr Trump may recall that another incident in Paris - the November 2015 mass shooting at the Bataclan theatre - helped solidify his lead in the polls leading into the Republican presidential primaries. \"Everyone is now saying how right I was with illegal immigration and the wall,\" he tweeted several days after the attack two years ago. \"After Paris, they're all on the bandwagon.\" Mr Trump did not mention her by name, but the president seems to be predicting the Champs-Elysees shooting will be a boost for French nationalist candidate Marine Le Pen, who has campaigned on deporting suspected Islamic militants and a French withdrawal from the European Union. Although Mr Trump has not formally met the French presidential candidate, she is close to some of the same advisers who helped craft the president's populist message during his campaign last year and was spotted in Trump Tower during the presidential transition in January. Breitbart News, which was an early supporter of Mr Trump's improbable presidential bid, has also warmly covered Ms Le Pen's efforts. \"A new world is emerging, global equilibriums are being redefined by the fact of Trump's election,\" Ms Le Pen said the day after Mr Trump's presidential victory. \"Their world is crumbling; ours is being built.\" While critics may view Mr Trump's Friday morning tweet as an unwelcome effort to influence the politics of another nation, the reality is slightly more complicated than that. Earlier on Thursday former President Barack Obama spoke with another leading French candidate, Emmanuel Macron, who has campaigned in favour of a strong European Union and open borders. \"The main message I have is to wish you all the best in the coming days.\" Mr Obama said in an edited video of the call that Mr Macron posted on Twitter. \"And make sure, as you said, that you work very hard all the way through because you never know, it might be that last day of campaigning that makes all the difference.\" \"Let's keep defending our progressive values,\" Mr Macron wrote. \"Thank you for this discussion @BarackObama\". In other words, the French election - from an American perspective, at least - could be setting up a proxy battle between the current and former president and their competing views of economic nationalism versus liberal globalism. A similar dynamic played out during last June's Brexit referendum in the UK, when Mr Obama tacitly endorsed the Remain camp, while Mr Trump heralded the Leave victory as evidence that his nationalist politics were gathering strength. Now, after two notable defeats for the existing international establishment - in Brexit and Mr Trump's November election - Mr Obama may view Mr Macron as a last, best hope to stem a rising populist tide in the West. Although European Union supporters were heartened by the results in the recent Dutch elections, where nationalist candidate Geert Wilders was defeated, the French vote is a much more significant matter. Mr Trump and his advisers may view Ms Le Pen as the hand that will deliver a death blow to the European Union and cement his own election as more than a quirk of American politics and, instead, as the harbinger of a new global order.

It seems odd to me she didn't spend more of the election campaign talking about helping those who are \"just managing\" as she called them in her first (well-received) Downing Street speech. Her defiance extended to an insistence she would stick to the existing timetable for Brexit talks and her ambition produced the phrase \"over the next five years\". Perhaps she was just trying to steady the ship amid calls for her to resign. The Conservatives are notoriously ruthless with leaders who fail and I wouldn't put my mortgage on her still being in place for the conclusion of Brexit talks. Conservative MPs I have spoken to think she has done the right thing for now and that resignation would have increased the uncertainty with all the impact that would have had on financial markets. What does the loss of the Conservative majority mean for Brexit? That is harder to say. There is a growing argument that it means Mrs May will have to compromise more and go for a \"softer\" Brexit. But that ignores the sizeable numbers of Conservative and DUP MPs who favour a \"clean Brexit\" that would mean leaving the single market, the customs union and not paying into the pot after the UK has left. It also relies on the assumption that the remaining 27 EU countries are prepared to offer a choice of Brexit. In one of the most telling interventions of the election campaign, David Cameron suggested that the prime minister needed a large majority to prevent (rather than deliver) an \"extreme Brexit\". \"It's so important,\" he said, \"that the Conservatives win and win well, so Theresa can negotiate that Brexit deal, so she can stand up to people who want an extreme Brexit either here or in Brussels.\" A tiny majority - or no majority at all - would leave Theresa May having to secure a deal that would satisfy the likes of both Sir William Cash and Kenneth Clarke, a tall order in any circumstances. Unless Mrs May takes the advice of the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, who suggests she talks to other political parties to try to secure a cross-party consensus on what she called \"an open Brexit\". Ruth Davidson was one of her party's silver linings, leading the Conservatives to victory in 13 seats. Labour have pointed out that under 'English Votes for English Laws' those Scottish Tory MPs won't be able to take part in some Commons votes on health and education in England. That shouldn't affect the Conservatives' chances of winning votes in those areas as 46 non-Conservative MPs from Scotland would face the same restriction. As indeed would the new Tories' new friends from Northern Ireland. The Conservatives still have a parliamentary majority in England but its modest size means that controversial issues such as the expansion of grammar schools may struggle to pass through the House of Commons.", "summary": "A visitor from another planet listening to the prime minister's speech outside No 10 on Friday could be forgiven for assuming nothing of significance happened the day before."}, {"text": "This edition in Lillehammer is only the second of its kind, with the first coming in Innsbruck in 2012. Over 10 days about 1100 athletes from 70 countries, aged between 15 and 18, will compete in 15 sports disciplines. Lillehammer 2016 will use many venues refurbished from the 1994 Winter Olympics, while Oslo, which is more than 100 miles away, will host the halfpipe events. The ethos of the Youth Olympics is cultural education and personal development, as well as an early introduction to the multi-sport environment, At Lillehammer 2016 the Sjoggfest [culture festival] offers athletes about 150 cultural and adventure experiences, such as ice climbing, parkour and live music acts. There are 70 gold medals at stake within the 15 disciplines at Lillehammer. Events familiar to Winter Olympic schedules, such as alpine skiing or speed skating, are part of the Games. But there are also some new formats on display in Norway. Alongside the regular ice hockey team format, there is an ice hockey skills challenge event where the individual must demonstrate their prowess with the skates, stick and puck in six different skill areas. In bobsleigh, rather than standard two-man or four-man bobs, the Olympians will compete in the monobob - where a single athlete rides by his or herself. And curling in Lillehammer will have not only mixed team curling - comprising a foursome of two boys and two girls from the same nation - but also a mixed doubles event, where boys and girls from different countries will pair up and compete together. The British Olympic Association has sent a team of 16 athletes to take part in alpine skiing, bobsleigh, curling, freestyle skiing, ice hockey skills challenge, luge and skeleton. This team size is down from the 23 who took part in Innsbruck in 2012. The youngest member of the team is Verity Lewis, who will be a month past her 15th birthday on Friday. She is Team GB's ice hockey skills challenge competitor. Leading team GB is chef de mission, Adam Pengilly, a former GB skeleton athlete who competed at the Winter Olympics in 2006 and 2010. Winter Olympics bronze medallist curler Claire Hamilton is with the team in the role of youth ambassador. GB's best medal hopes appear to lie in the sliding sports. In monobob, 17-year-olds George Johnston and Kelsea Purchall are both ranked number one in the world. Another monobob athlete, 17-year-old Annabel Chaffey, was also ranked top in the world at the end of the 2014-2015 season. Also in medal form at the sliding centre is Ashleigh Pittaway in the skeleton. The Munich-born 15-year-old won four qualifying races for Lillehammer 2016 and took her first senior bronze medal at the European Cup in Konigssee, Germany, in January. Developing young people is one part of the Winter Youth Olympics, but nurturing the next batch of senior level Olympians is also an objective. From Innsbruck 2012, Team GB included the freestyle skier, Katie Summerhayes, who went on to compete at the Sochi Winter Games two years later. She then became the first British woman to win a freestyle skiing World Championship medal when she took silver in the 2015 slopestyle event. As well as Summerhayes, Jazmin Sawyers was part of the silver-winning bobsleigh team in Innsbruck.

It calls for \"accurate information and respectful debate\" from politicians. The Home Office said extra money had been allocated to tackle hate crime. The commission's letter, which is co-signed by its chairman David Isaac and chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath, said politicians had spoken about \"the need to heal the country and bring people together\" following the UK's EU referendum. But instead, it said: \"There is growing concern that the divisions on a range of big questions are widening and exacerbating tensions in our society.\" It pointed to the killing of Arkadiusz Jozwick, racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic attacks on the streets, and reports of hijabs being pulled off, all of which it described as \"stains on our society\". The letter comes after Thomas Mair was jailed for life on Wednesday for the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox during the referendum campaign. Prosecutors said the attack was \"nothing less than acts of terrorism\" and the judge said it was carried out to advance a political cause of violent white supremacism. The commission, an independent statutory body which advises on equality and human rights law, said: \"We are concerned that attacks on supporters of both sides of the Brexit debate have polarised many parts of the country. \"There are those who used, and continue to use, public concern about immigration policy and the economy to legitimise hate. \"The vast majority of people who voted to leave the European Union did so because they believe it is best for Britain and not because they are intolerant of others.\" It describes the Brexit vote as a \"defining moment\" for the country, saying that while the focus has been on the economic and trading implications there should also be a \"discussion on what values we hold as a country\". The letter also criticises the government's aborted plan to demand companies set out the proportion of foreigners they employ, which was announced by Home Secretary Amber Rudd at the Conservative Party conference in October. It said \"politicians of all sides should be aware of the effect on national mood of their words and policies, even when they are not enacted\". The letter also mentioned the discussion around child migrants, \"where dialogue escalated to irrational levels\". And it said there had been an \"ambivalent reception\" to claims of anti-Semitism in politics, an issue that BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said had dogged the Labour Party in particular. The commission said it welcomed the government's hate crime plans, but said more concerted action was needed. It suggested there should be a review of the sentences for hate crimes in England and Wales.

One of India's most successful actresses, her political career was marked by allegations of self-enrichment to fund an extravagant lifestyle. As head of the AIADMK party, she was elected as chief minister of Tamil Nadu on four occasions, overcoming convictions and jail terms to return to office. Jayalalitha was born on 24 February 1948 in what was then the Mysore State. Her father was a lawyer who squandered most of the family fortune and who died when she was only two years old. She excelled at school and, after studying music and dance, began training as an actress. Over the ensuing three decades she became one of India's most popular, and high-profile artists, appearing in more than 140 films. Naturally charismatic, she was introduced to politics by the actor-turned chief minister, MG Ramachandran, with whom she starred in many of her films. Elected to the Tamil Nadu Assembly in 1989 she took over the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Khazagham (AIADMK) party becoming the first ever woman opposition leader. A year later she became chief minister for the first time. She championed the cause of the rural and urban poor by introducing subsidised food canteens, providing free laptops to thousands of school pupils and students and launching other populist schemes like giving away food mixers and grinders to families. Many publicly funded projects in Tamil Nadu were named after her, including a subsidy scheme, under which canteens served food at low prices. They were dubbed Amma Canteens - Amma in Tamil is Mother, an honorific euphemism by which Jayalalitha was often addressed by her followers in the state. These were followed by Amma Bottled Water, Amma Salt, Amma Pharmacies and subsidised Amma Cement. She attracted a level of support that verged on the bizarre. Some followers were known to profess their loyalty through acts such as walking on hot coals or drawing her portrait with their blood and her officials were reported to prostrate themselves at her feet. Incidents of her loyalists setting fire to themselves whenever she faced political setbacks were not unknown. She did much to encourage this cult of personality and huge cut outs of Jayalalitha dominated the Tamil Nadu skyline. Her first term in office came to an abrupt end in 1996 when her party won only four seats in the Legislative Assembly and she lost her own Bargur constituency. The new ruling party wasted little time in investigating allegations of corruption amongst growing concerns about her extravagant lifestyle. During one raid on her premises following a corruption allegation in 1996, police said they had found large quantities of diamond-studded gold jewellery, more than 10,000 saris and 750 pairs of shoes. She was eventually charged with receiving financial incentives in a scheme to buy more than 40,000 colour televisions for local villages and served 30 days in jail. She was barred from standing in the 2001 elections because she had been sentenced to five years imprisonment following allegations she had illegally obtained state-owned property However, her party swept back into power and she was reappointed chief minister despite not having been elected to the state assembly. Although her tenure was swiftly ended, her successor was effectively under her control and in 2003, when her conviction was overturned, she successfully contested a vacant assembly seat and was once more chief minister of Tamil Nadu. But controversy continued to dog her. There were allegations that she used the Tamil Nadu Marketing Corporation (Tasmac) - which had a monopoly on the sale of alcohol in the state - to pay for many of her pet projects. The continuing allegations seemed to do little to dim her charisma or lower her popularity. Following the elections in April 2011, she was sworn in as chief minister for a third term. She was said to nurse ambitions of a greater role in national politics. In the run-up to the 2014 Indian parliamentary elections many of her followers suggested she aspired to become India's prime minister, although she did not confirm this. In 2014 she was sentenced to four years in jail after being convicted of using her position to amass a huge property portfolio as well as a collection of expensive jewellery and luxury cars. It saw her become the first Indian chief minister ever to be removed from office. However, eight months later, in May 2015, the conviction was overturned and within days she was reinstated as chief minister of Tamil Nadu. In the following year's elections she swept back into power, winning her own seat by a handsome margin and retaining the post of chief minister. \"Even when 10 parties allied themselves against me, I did not have a coalition and I placed my faith in God and built an alliance with the people.\" she said. \"It is clear that the people have faith in me and I have total faith in the people.\" Jayalalitha's supporters say she was instrumental in making Tamil Nadu one of India's most economically influential states.

Beaming with a bright smile I waved back immediately, then embarrassment set in. I realised the recognition wasn't for me, it was for another Ballymena man standing just to my left, the head groundsman at PSG. I was immensely proud for Jonathan Calderwood. A man raised just 'up the road' from me in Clough, County Antrim. This is a matchday ritual for Jonathan, receiving accolades from some of the world's most expensive footballers. \"When we played Barcelona, I was told that Messi and Neymar both said it was the best pitch they've ever played on, when we played Real Madrid in September I got the same feedback from them,\" he said. It all started at east Belfast club Glentoran, where Jonathan cut his teeth (and grass) at the Oval. Next stop was the old Wembley Stadium in London, which coincided with his studies at Myrescough College, where he gained a National Diploma in Turf Science. Jonathan worked his way through the ranks, ending up as deputy head groundsman at Wembley. Calderwood went on to become head groundsman at Wolverhampton Wanderers before a move to Aston Villa. During 15 successful years at Villa Park he picked up multiple turf related awards including two Premier League Groundsman of the Year trophies. At Villa he met Gerard Houillier, one of the game's most respected managers. Meanwhile, across the English Channel a group of investors from Qatar made PSG one of Europe's richest football clubs. They wanted the very best of everything, including the blades of grass on the Parc des Princes pitch. On the advice of Houllier that meant a groundsman from Clough. He told PSG that Jonathan was the best groundsman in the world and Carlo Ancelotti, their manager at that time, agreed. Jonathan and his family moved to a new life in Paris and he made an immediate impact, becoming French Groundman of the Year in his first season. He added: \"When you hear someone saying 'the guy just cuts grass' it's a little bit hurtful because I know what skills are involved, what dedication, what hours, what knowledge and experience goes into having a pitch like what we have at PSG. \"Modern day football pitches are so complex and so complicated. I spent three years full-time at university and I would say 90% of my time was spent in the laboratory doing soil analysis, weeds, pesticides, disease management, wind, water, sunshine, fertiliser programmes and aeration - there is so much to it.' Jonathan's story doesn't end there, for his pitch will host Northern Ireland's game against Germany in Euro 2016. \"If you're a groundsman like me, you want to work at the very top and it doesn't come much bigger than the European Championships,\" he said. \"For me to move to Paris and for Northern Ireland to end up playing Germany in Paris on my pitch it doesn't get any better than that - it's like a dream come true.\" So Jonathan has already had recognition from some of the best players in the world - come 21 June he'll be hoping for a thumbs up from the likes of Steven Davis, Jonny Evans and manager Michael O'Neill.

The UK as a whole scored particularly badly on obesity, being the fattest nation of all. And within the UK it was the West Midlands that had the highest percentage of obese adults at 29% - double the EU average of 14% and much higher than the 19% rate seen in Greater London. The UK's female death rates from cancer were also among the worst in Europe. Deaths in south-east England were the highest at 185 per 100,000, followed by Scotland at 179 per 100,000 and north-east England at 174. This compares with the European average of 139.5 per 100,000.

The public went down one flight of stone stairs and then there were three long arches. \"At the end of one of the long arches was a little tiny stage. That's where the Beatles performed 292 times. \"I remember it being very highly charged with excitement. The music sounded even more exciting [than the previous gigs] because The Cavern was this little squashed space so the music sounded a bit louder, a bit more exciting and a bit more vital. About 20 to 30 people were there. \"The Beatles were the complete package - they didn't just have a great singer, they had two great singers. They always did harmonies right from the very first time I saw them. \"They could probably only afford two microphones, and so when one was doing the lead singing the other two were facing each other on the mic, and it was quite charismatic, it was nice to look at. They had a camaraderie about them. \"I never heard them singing one of their own songs because they were just a straight covers band at that time, as was everybody else in Liverpool. \"The standard songs that they sang - them and the other bands in Liverpool - were [by] Chuck Berry, Little Richard, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly. The sound that I very clearly remember the Beatles playing in the Cavern was a Chuck Berry riff. \"As well as doing the stock standards, the Beatles were a bit different because they were better at playing complicated chords. The Beatles were a bit more adventurous. \"It wasn't just the music and the singing, it was their lack of respect for the audience. At the Cavern for those first few gigs, they were quite irreverent to the audience and other people. They were sort of the first punk band. The Beatles were a law unto themselves on the stage. \"They were still doing that when they went to America - if someone asked them a question they didn't give a serious answer, and that's how they behaved on stage in the Cavern, and that's why I think they liked it in the Cavern. \"They were the epitome of rebellion in Liverpool because they weren't trying to imitate Cliff Richard and the Shadows doing little in time steps. They would dance out of step on purpose. \"That was their purpose in life - to upset the apple cart. They were so cheeky and so entertaining all around. They were a little bit of a voice for us against authority. I think they were rebels. We were mini rebels supporting them. \"Of course when I went back to work I used to stand gazing out of the window thinking about the Beatles and the girls at the Cavern. I couldn't really concentrate on doing any work. \"Just in a few weeks they'd gained a bigger following. When word went around, the crowd grew and people kept coming back. Once you'd seen them, not many people didn't go to see them again. \"They had big long queues, right down the length of the street and even round the corner at the bottom. But at that stage I'd dumped them. \"They started talking about going to London and making records and things like that. Betrayal. \"I wasn't the only one.

But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over. David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler. Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered \"almost jokingly\" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world. And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply. So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget. And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives. The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries. Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: \"According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere. \"This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. \" At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire. As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes. \"That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes,\" Dr Williams said. Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours. ColaLife Donkey Ambulance CentriCycle ColaLife Air bed invention is 'donkey ambulance' CentriCycle The team has designed changeable heads allowing it be converted into a number of devices. One of its most promising uses so far has been as a laryngoscope - an instrument which lights-up the back of the mouth allowing anaesthetists to insert breathing tubes when people are unable to breathe for themselves. It has already been tested in military hospitals in Afghanistan, in Uganda and after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. \"In Haiti we saw a lady with a neck injury who urgently needed a tracheal tube to help stabilise her. There were no other functioning laryngoscopes close by and the ShakerScope worked well despite the difficult case,\" said Dr Williams. According to Dr Williams the project has been a series of steep learning curves. \"Having the good idea is the easy part. Making it into a reality required an almost obsessive degree of dedication,\" he said. In the early days the doctors tried to do as much as possible from home - from teaching themselves microelectronics to perfecting their computer-aided design skills.

The simple truth was that the combined list of candidates headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had performed disappointingly. But politics is about expectations. At one point a rumour swept the gathering that he'd lost more than a third of his alliance's seats in the Knesset - in the end the exit polls suggested it would be more like a quarter. Cue wild celebration. If you add together Mr Netanyahu's natural allies among the religious parties and the rest of the right - and assume he'll be able to attract at least one party from the centre or even the left - then he should be able to form a government again. Senior Likud figure Danny Danon was quick to tell me that the only thing that would be remembered from this night was the fact that his boss had won a third term as prime minister. \"There is only one prime minister possible for Israel from these results. And that's Benjamin Netanyahu. \"I say to my friends here on the left that they should not be opening the champagne after these results.\" Any champagne that Mr Netanyahu may be tempted to open will be feeling a little flat though. He emerges from these elections a rather diminished figure, whose wheeling and dealing skills may be sorely tested as he sets about building a new coalition. When he spoke to a crowd of activists in Tel Aviv he was measured, although it took him some time to persuade his supporters to stop celebrating long enough to make himself heard. \"I am going to seek as broad a government as possible\", he said. \" I'm going to seek out many partners.\" That was perhaps his way of acknowledging that the overall results of the night were curiously ambiguous. To the left of Mr Netanyahu, Labour picked up seats but to the right of him so did Habayit Hayehudi (Jewish Home party) led by his former chief of staff Naftali Bennett. The undoubted star of the evening was Yair Lapid, a famous TV presenter who stepped off the screen to found a new centrist party called Yesh Atid (There is a Future). It has been an extraordinary debut. The party may well emerge as the second largest grouping in the new Knesset and should command a place in a Netanyahu-led coalition. Because Mr Lapid is a political newcomer, it's hard to say what price he might try to extract in return for his support. But you can expect a higher profile for the vexed issue of whether Israel's ultra-Orthodox community ought to be required to perform its share of national service (it's currently exempt). The wider world will examine these results for clues about Israel's future attitude towards peace talks with the Palestinians or the possibility of a pre-emptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. The truth of the matter is that it's far too early to make those kind of judgements, which will depend on the balance of forces within a future coalition more than on the outcome of the popular vote. But the sudden and decisive lurch to the right that many predicted hasn't happened. The results show that there's plenty of life on the left and the centre of Israeli politics too. Some political journalists at Likud headquarters were arguing within hours of the exit polls that the results sent such a confused signal about the political mood in Israel that they made another election likely within a year. We'll see. Having said this is a chastening result for Benjamin Netanyahu it's only fair to record that it's been a thought provoking one for anyone in the business of making political predictions here, too. Mr Netanyahu was supposed to win easily - and he certainly didn't. And the campaign was supposed to have failed to capture the Israeli imagination - and turnout was remarkably high. It's said to take an average of well over a month to form a coalition government after polling day here - and there's no reason to assume that it will be any quicker than the average this time around. The first contacts between party leaders were probably under way before the celebrations at Likud HQ had died away.

Ms Le Pen, 48, has been holding her rally in the working-class Paris suburb of Villepinte. Referring to Mr Macron's period as a minister in President Hollande's government, she accused him of being a \"candidate of continuity... littered with the corpses of jobs transferred off-shore, the ruins of bust businesses, and the gaping holes of deficit and debt\". Ms Le Pen has won support in rural and former industrial areas by promising to retake control of France's borders from the EU and slash immigration. Earlier, her estranged father - FN founder Jean-Marie Le Pen - attended a march from the statue of Joan of Arc, a long-time FN icon.

Sunday was France's national day of remembrance for the French Jews who were deported to Nazi Germany during the Second World War. Mr Macron visited Paris's Holocaust memorial to pay his respects, while Ms Le Pen laid a wreath at the World War Two monument in Marseille. But the war remains a difficult area for Ms Le Pen.

I guess we'll have to put up with their telephone reminders.\" Elena and her husband owe well over 1m roubles (about \u00a310,800; $17,000) to those four banks. After the cash piles are sorted the family of three is left with only 10,000 roubles (\u00a3107; $167). That puts them below the poverty line - and recently Elena lost her job. Millions of those in debt live like Elena. According to the Russian United Credit Bureau (UCB), 40 million Russians have loans or mortgages. By June, 12.5m of those loans had not been paid for at least a month, and in another 8m cases the arrears stretched back over three months. The Russian Central Bank says total personal debt has risen to 1tn roubles (\u00a310.7bn; $16.7bn). At least 10% of that amount cannot be recovered by the banks. For Elena and her husband, this is a story of almost two decades of borrowing. They started getting loans in the mid-1990s to pay for their daughter's medical treatment. Then they took a bigger loan to pay off the smaller ones. It all seemed manageable, says Elena, but then new expenses came along - and two banks offered credit cards with generous conditions. \"We were a bit stupid,\" Elena says. \"They told us the minimum payment was 5,000 roubles a month and we paid that every month. But that was just the interest, not the loan itself.\" During Russia's boom years credit history checks meant virtually nothing. An individual already saddled with loans could take out another one, hoping to pay off previous debts. The small print was often too small to bother about. Then the music stopped. Money got tight after the 2008 global financial crisis and Western sanctions against Russia over its role in the Ukraine conflict. The average personal loan in 2014 was 54,600 roubles. Olga Mazurova is head of Sentinel Credit Management, one of Russia's largest debt-collecting agencies. She says that often Russians are hit by a sudden drop in income, because \"the firm goes bankrupt, the working week is cut, there are layoffs or wage cuts - we see that especially in industrial cities in Siberia and the Urals\". Few Russians have insurance for such contingencies, she says. Debtors cannot get much help. There are plans to amend the law on insolvency, to allow individuals to be declared bankrupt. But nothing will happen on that until October. Russian MPs decided that criminal courts were unprepared for the likely flood of such cases and that courts of arbitration should handle debt cases instead. Each debtor has to beg the bank to cut them some slack. But Russia's financial ombudsman Pavel Medvedev says that rarely works if someone owes money to more than one institution. A former adviser to President Vladimir Putin, he knows many top Russian financiers personally - but that does not help him to lobby on behalf of indebted callers. Typically, he says, lenders refuse to restructure personal debts with the words: \"I've got a business to run and shareholders demand profits - I can't do it!\" Mr Medvedev says his success rate in helping debtors has dropped from 51% to 33% and \"this year it's probably going to be around 16%\". He had no solution for one caller, Vladimir Frolov, living near Moscow. Mr Frolov started borrowing four years ago to help his partner, living separately from him, in Ukraine. The debts snowballed. Finally, unable to get an unsecured loan, he mortgaged the flat he shares with his elderly parents. His father Anatoly, who co-signed the agreement, is bewildered when asked which bank it was. \"How should I know? They took us into some room, the light was dim and the print was tiny. I just asked if everything was alright and they told me it was.\" Besides the mortgage, Vladimir Frolov's parents took out two loans to help him, which eat up 18,000 of their 22,000-rouble monthly pension allowance. And now Vladimir has defaulted on the mortgage. The bank is suing and they may well lose their only dwelling. \"There must be a normal way out - maybe give the bank a fixed share of my wages?\" Vladimir wonders. But so far he has not found anyone at the bank to discuss his dilemma. \"Isn't there a law against this?\" asks his father, equally helplessly. \"How can they let people borrow so much without checking them first?\" After the good years many Russians are now getting a harsh lesson in capitalism - and inadequate regulations mean there is nothing to soften the blow.", "summary": "Millions of Russians took out loans during the economic boom years, but now they face crippling debts and the law is not on their side, the BBC's Oleg Boldyrev reports."}, {"text": "Public Health Wales (PHW) research also showed one in five of those who breastfeed do so for less than a month.

It said babies not receiving enough milk were at risk of jaundice, hypoglycemia and dehydration. \"All mothers who wish to breastfeed should be supported in doing so while ensuring their child receives all the nutrition they need to remain healthy and safe. \"We have found that mothers often feel immense pressure by society and by current breastfeeding protocols to only breastfeed their newborns, even when they do not have enough milk to do so.\" Women can also experience pain, bleeding or cracked nipples, especially if the baby has not attached properly. PHW's survey showed 51% of people asked were definitely planning to breastfeed when they became parents in future - meaning 49% were going to bottle feed or were unsure. As part of its campaign, mothers offered advice to breastfeeding parents and those considering feeding options. PHW said breastfed babies were more likely to grow up a healthy weight and were at less risk of high blood pressure and heart disease as they got older.

They are good family cars.\" Jaguar Land Rover, which also has manufacturing bases in Castle Bromwich and Halewood on Merseyside, has said the latest announcement will bring the total number of jobs it has created in the UK over the past three years to almost 11,000. Mr Tildesley said the firm's investment had \"undoubtedly\" boosted Solihull with other firms benefiting from knock-on trade. Rachael Eade, from the Manufacturing Advisory Service, said every job created by vehicle manufacturers leads to two or three in the supply chain. \"It's a huge confidence booster locally and UK-wide,\" she said. \"It's 1,700 jobs and three times that in the supply chain. \"I think the new technology involved will attract a new, younger market and will make a difference to the supply chain. \"Younger people have more of a desire to be involved in that as they probably view car manufacturing to be a bit dusty, dirty and not for them.\" But not everyone is happy. Some shops said the expansion had brought with it increased parking problems. Terry Cosma, manager of Solihull Fish Bar in Hob's Moat Road, said: \"I have not noticed any change in business. We have always had a steady flow of JLR workers. \"The big problem is the lack of parking round here. They are along the pavements, the grass verges, sometimes it's difficult to get into the side roads.\" Julie Jones, who works at Trev's Hairdressers, also in Hob's Moat Road, said: \"The parking is ridiculous - diabolical. \"There is nowhere for us to go because all the Land Rover workers are there.\" In 2005, MG Rover based at Longbridge, less than 10 miles from Solihull, went into administration. About 14,000 people employed by the Rover group were based at the site.

They suggest the hotspot is created by thunderous soundwaves \"breaking\" in the thin upper reaches of the atmosphere. The research is published in Nature. It arguably solves what planetary scientists had dubbed an \"energy crisis\" for gas giants like Jupiter: temperatures in their upper atmospheres soar much higher than can be explained by solar energy - especially given their vast distances from the Sun. If the mysterious heat were generated by local sources, like Jupiter's famous storm, then the conundrum would be solved - and these measurements are the first direct evidence of any such activity. Study co-author Dr Tom Stallard, from the University of Leicester, said this was a major step forward in a \"20-30 year odyssey\" to try and understand heat flow on Jupiter. \"Ever since Voyager, we've had measurements of the temperature at the top of Jupiter's atmosphere, and it's been hot across the whole globe - from the poles, all the way to the equator,\" he told the BBC. Jupiter's enormous, dramatic aurora can explain the heat in the polar regions, but for that warmth to reach the equator would require incredibly dramatic mixing, which modelling studies haven't been able to support. \"There's no real excuse for it to be so hot,\" said Dr James O'Donoghue from Boston University, the paper's first author. The freshly discovered spike in temperature, detected using a spectrometer at the Nasa Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) in Mauna Kea, Hawaii, offers a solution. Several hundred km directly above the clouds of the Great Red Spot, the hotspot suggests that high-altitude heat is somehow created by the turmoil beneath. \"Several people have argued that it's likely that the heat comes from below, but the observations have never backed them up,\" Dr Stallard said. He and his colleagues don't know exactly what is causing the heat, but they have some ideas. It could be driven by great Jovian thunderclaps, rumbling upwards from the churning red clouds of the Solar System's biggest storm. \"You get some kind of acoustic event, probably thunder or something like that - or possibly other forms of sound energy - and that propagates directly upwards,\" Dr Stallard explained. \"That wave will continue going upwards until it reaches a lower-density region at the top of the atmosphere, and then it breaks and deposits all that wave energy into the top of the atmosphere, just like waves break on the shore - as the water gets thinner, it's less able to carry that wave and so it breaks and you see lots of energy.\" There is a precedent for such sound-driven warming much closer to home, according to Dr O'Donoghue. \"There is some evidence in Earth's atmosphere, above storms and above features such as mountains - the Andes mountains in fact - that there are acoustic waves emanating from them, and that they propagate up into the atmosphere and cause heating there,\" he said. The key to revealing the temperature spike was a tiny ion: H3+, a hydrogen molecule (H2) with an added proton. It is incredibly reactive and consequently, short-lived and rare on Earth. But in the sparse fringe of Jupiter's outer atmosphere there is almost nothing else for it to react with. Crucially, this ion works like a glowing, long-range thermometer for scientists, if they have the right sort of telescope - such as the spectrometer at the IRTF, which gathered the relevant data in a single nine-hour window back in 2012. \"Just by measuring its light, you can find out the temperature wherever it is,\" said Dr O'Donoghue. \"And it's throughout all of the gas giant upper atmospheres - so it's essentially an in situ temperature probe.\" Further insights might come from Nasa's Juno spacecraft, now in orbit around Jupiter after its five-year trek. Dr Stallard said that telescopes around the world were trained on the gas giant to take parallel measurements - and his team had planned their observations with the mission in mind. \"We thought, this is something that we haven't addressed, and it needed addressing. We've really ramped up our studies away from the aurora. \"Juno's going to reveal magnificent levels of detail about... what the aurora are and how they're generated. But it will be interesting to see how much it tells us about the non-auroral regions and the top of the atmosphere. \"Obviously it's been designed to look deep, and to look at the aurora at the poles, but potentially Juno could reveal a lot more.\" Follow Jonathan on Twitter", "summary": "Jupiter's Great Red Spot - a hurricane three times bigger than Earth - is blasting the planet's upper atmosphere with heat, astronomers have found."}, {"text": "South Yorkshire Police's public protection unit spent a \"great deal of time\" trying to \"disprove\" allegations, said HM Inspectorate of Constabulary. It said the force's public protection unit showed \"a disregard for victims\". A separate report on Tuesday found a \"collective failure\" by the authorities to stop child abuse in Rotherham. That inquiry, by Professor Alexis Jay, said at least 1,400 children were sexually exploited from 1997-2013, mainly by gangs of men of Pakistani heritage. The new investigation, which saw HMIC inspectors visit South Yorkshire Police in February, threatened to put more pressure on police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright. He has so far resisted calls to resign as commissioner, with David Cameron and Nick Clegg the latest politicians to call for him to go. He has quit the Labour Party. Mr Wright was the councillor responsible children's services at Rotherham Borough Council between 2005 and 2010. In a statement, Mr Wright said he had \"formally\" tendered his resignation from the Labour Party. But he insisted he was the most appropriate person to hold the office of police and crime commissioner (PCC). The HMIC report said South Yorkshire Police's public protection unit (PPU) had a cultural \"disregard for victims\". It criticised the unit for under-recording crime, highlighting the impact this had on vulnerable children who had been victims of sexual assault. The HMIC looked at 117 crimes that should have been recorded, but found that only 89 had been. Of those, three were wrongly classified. The report highlighted \"a serious need for improvement in the accuracy and timeliness of crime recording decisions\". It said: \"There is an inherent risk that a significant number of reported offences of a serious nature have not been recorded and that vulnerable victims have, as a consequence, been left unprotected or at risk of further offending.\" The force welcomed the HMIC report, but it said it was important to note it was about the recording of crime and not the way it was investigated. \"We recognise that systems need improving and there is a programme in place to do so, including IT and the force's public protection unit stand-alone system,\" the statement said. Rotherham isn't alone in facing the distressing problem of child sexual abuse. But the report exposed a deeply dysfunctional system here. The council insists things have improved significantly in recent years. Many, though, are still shocked that efforts to confront exploitation fell woefully short. Was there a particular problem specific to Rotherham? Did Labour's total dominance of this authority allow a complacent, rotten culture to develop? Was the political opposition so enfeebled that effective challenge to the leadership was striking by its absence? As people here reflect on these political questions, it's worth thinking for a moment about the complex, corporate identity of modern councils. Social workers report to safeguarding managers, child protection co-ordinators, directors of services, and chief executives. All overseen by 63 elected councillors. Such a complex web of relationships. So many different chains of command - making true accountability very hard to establish. South Yorkshire Police is already under scrutiny after Professor Jay's report criticised police for not making child sexual exploitation (CSE) a priority and \"regarding many child victims with contempt\". The force currently has 173 \"live\" investigations into suspected CSE. The number includes 32 probes in Rotherham, a spokeswoman for the force said.

There is also a desperate shortage of workers. Half the workforce has left the dam for other jobs on account of not being paid for up to five months. We had special access inside the dam's labyrinth of tunnels to see the urgent problems first-hand. Outdated machinery is still being used to try to stabilise the dam's foundations. The dam's deputy director, Mohsen Yaqoub, showed us samples of soil that had suffered erosion. \"These black parts are the treated cement used to inject into the holes and fractures created by the water that constantly eats away at the unstable foundation of the dam,\" he said. \"The dam is today in danger because of the erosion at the natural gypsum base under the water and serious erosion at the flow gates. \"The joints at the two main gates have been dislocated vertically and horizontally, which could lead to the collapse of the dam but we don't know when. It could happen next month, next year or in five years' time. We actually don't know when.\" The Iraqi government has been struggling for more than two years to strike a deal with an international company to undertake the much-needed repair works. Insecurity is scaring away bidders and the economic crisis has forced the oil-rich country to seek help from the World Bank and key allies like the United States. \"We just have empty promises from the international community to repair the dam,\" said Mr Yaqoub, who was previously an engineer at the site for 28 years. \"I met the American advisers and took them in a tour inside the dam. They were just nodding at my detailed scientific explanation of the dangers and the efforts made by us to protect the structure.\" Mosul and other northern cities in the path of the river would be vulnerable if the dam fails. At present, locals say they are not aware of any emergency warning systems to deal with a potential catastrophe in waiting. And if this dam collapsed, it would cause massive devastation to entire communities along the Tigris River. Cities such as Mosul, Tikrit, Samarra and even down to the capital Baghdad are the most vulnerable. Massive floods could kill and render homeless hundreds of thousands, the US state department has warned. Asked what he would do if the dam fails, 22-year-old shepherd Amin Jabouri, who tends his flocks close by, had an immediate response. \"We have no other option but to head for a higher ground.

The State of Food & Agriculture 2016 report said \"business as usual\" would leave millions at risk from hunger. Last year, nations adopted a UN goal of ending hunger by 2030. \"The climate is changing, so agriculture must change too,\" explained Rob Voss, director of FAO's Agricultural Development Economics division. \"We are saying that because agriculture is already very affected by the impacts of climate change, particularly the countries in the tropical zones. \"Also, agriculture is contributing itself to about one fifth of the global emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases,\" Mr Voss, who headed the team that produced the FAO State of Food & Agriculture 2016 report, added. \"If we continue along the present pathways then we will not be able to [deliver] food security around the world and we will not be able to stabilise the climate.\" As a result, he told BBC News, there was a need for \"major changes\" to take place in the sector. \"One of the challenges is agriculture itself. As soon as we shovel the ground then we are already releasing greenhouse gas emissions. Also, as it is so dependent on water and quality of land, any impact from the change in climate has a direct impact.\" Therefore, he said, the challenge was bearing these changes in mind and looking at ways to shift to a more sustainable footing. \"A lot of the technologies that are available that allow us to do things differently do face a number of hurdles, especially when it comes to smallholder farmers in developing countries.' These include the cost of changing the way farmers produce their food; knowledge of shifting to the novel ways of farming; urbanisation; access to water. In terms of making the change to deliver a robust global food system, Mr Voss said the report highlighted four steps that could be taken: \"First, put in the steps that would help farmers switch to more sustainable practices, such as more efficient use of fertilizers and using heat tolerant and drought resistant crop varieties.\" He added that management systems, such as agroforestry - which places forestry cultivation around farmlands, would also be beneficial as it helps farmers build in great resilience against the impacts of climate change. \"Secondly, we need to work harder to increase the capacity of soils and forestry to sequestrate carbon. Deforestation and changes to land-use is one of the major sources of emissions from the sector. \"A third area where we can immediately start work on is to reduce food losses and waste. We estimate that about one third of the food we produce gets lost in the post-harvest process or gets wasted at the consumer end. \"The fourth area, which is more challenging, is to try and do something about people's diets. What we have been seeing around the world is a clear shift towards increasing demands for food products that put a lot more pressure on natural resources.\" The report observed: \"Rebalancing diets towards less animal-sourced foods would make an important contribution in this direction, with probable co-benefits for human health.\" FAO director-general Jose Graziano da Silva said that the coming twelve months should be about \"putting commitments into action\", referring to the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goal of delivering \"zero hunger\" by 2030. He also observed that agriculture was set to be one of the main topics for discussion at the forthcoming UN climate summit in Morocco in November. \"Climate change threatens all dimensions of food security,\" Mr Graziano da Silva warned. \"It will expose both urban and rural poor to higher and more volatile food prices. It will also affect food availability by reducing the productivity of crops, livestock and fisheries.\" He stated: \"Hunger, poverty and climate change need to be tackled together.\" Follow Mark on Twitter.", "summary": "The global farming sector has a big role to play in the effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to future climate change, the UN says."}, {"text": "First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced last week that the government-led task force would \"fight for a future for our steel industry\".

It is the latest in a series of task forces set up to tackle problems ranging from job losses to environmental crime and the refugee crisis. But what do they do? Who sits on them and how successful have they been? BBC Scotland's business and economy editor Douglas Fraser has heard from one veteran of these task forces who described them as \"largely useless\". This was set up at the start of October \"to support workers and communities affected by Young's Seafood's decision to reduce its operations in the town\". The move followed a decision by Sainsbury's to transfer a \u00c2\u00a3100m fish processing contract away from Young's, resulting in the loss of 650 jobs. The business minister said after its first meeting on 2 October: \"The Task Force will also consider how to support longer term sustainable employment in the wider area. \"This work will take a number of months and all members of the Task Force agreed today to collaborate closely to deliver an Economic Recovery Plan that meets the needs and aspirations of the workers, the people of Fraserburgh and surrounding communities.\" The Fraserburgh team is made up of representatives of Young's, the Usdaw union, Scottish Enterprise, Skills Development Scotland, Aberdeenshire Council, local MPs and MSPs. Also taking their place around the table are Highlands & Islands Enterprise, Skills Development Scotland, the Department of Work and Pensions, the Scottish Seafood Association, the Scottish Pelagic Processors Association and Seafood Scotland. An emergency summit was convened in Edinburgh on 11 September at which First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland stood ready to take at least 1,000 new refugees \"as an immediate priority\". Represented on the task force are the Scottish and UK governments, Scottish Refugee Council, British Red Cross, Glasgow Girls, STUC, New Scots, City of Edinburgh Council, Cosla, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, the DWP and Police Scotland. Following the meeting, the Scottish government's Europe Minister Humza Yousaf said: \"It is very encouraging to hear that the majority of councils have indicated a willingness to accommodate refugees - we will now build on this positive response and ensure the appropriate support and integration services are put in place.\" Established by Richard Lochhead, Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment, this was tasked with \"supporting delivery of the Scottish government's commitment to tackling environmental crime\". The task force, which presented its findings to the Scottish government in June 2013, said it had looked to \"define environmental crime, identify opportunities and priorities for preventing, tackling and deterring environmental crime, improve co-ordination between law enforcement agencies and others and make proposals for legislation, research and other measures to tackle environmental crime\". It was made up of the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, the Scottish government's Environmental Quality Division, Justice department and Natural Resources Division, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers (UK). In March, Scottish Power announced plans to close its huge coal-fired power station at Longannet in Fife early next year. The move came after the energy firm failed to win a crucial contract from the National Grid. The Longannet Task Force, again chaired by Fergus Ewing, met on 24 August and was made up of local MPs and MSPs, trades unions, businesses and government agencies. It will reconvene next month once final figures have been produced to show how many Longannet employees want to take redundancy, seek redeployment within the company or find a new job. Hugh Finlay, Scottish Power's generation director, said: \"The taskforce continues to make good progress and all parties around the table are working closely together to put forward a viable economic plan for the region.

He said at the time: \"It's very frustrating. I think everyone involved in the Hall's site just wanted honesty.

In his column the 82-year-old retired Anglican Archbishop of South Africa said: \"I think when you need machines to help you breathe, then you have to ask questions about the quality of life being experienced and about the way money is being spent.\" He also described as \"disgraceful\" how former South African leader Nelson Mandela was kept alive with intensive hospitalisation in the final stages of his life and was photographed with various visiting politicians. He said: \"You could see Madiba [Nelson Mandela] was not fully there. He did not speak. He was not connecting. My friend was no longer himself. It was an affront to Madiba's dignity. \"Yes, I think a lot of people would be upset if I said I wanted assisted dying. I would say I wouldn't mind actually.\" He said: \"I have been fortunate to spend my life working for dignity for the living. Now I wish to apply my mind to the issue of dignity for the dying. I revere the sanctity of life - but not at any cost.\" His comments follow those of Lord Carey, who wrote in the Daily Mail that he had dropped his opposition to the Assisted Dying Bill - due for debate in the House of Lords on Friday - \"in the face of the reality of needless suffering\". \"The fact is that I have changed my mind. The old philosophical certainties have collapsed in the face of the reality of needless suffering,\" he wrote. The 1961 Suicide Act makes it an offence to encourage or assist a suicide or a suicide attempt in England and Wales. Anyone doing so could face up to 14 years in prison. The law is almost identical in Northern Ireland. There is no specific law on assisted suicide in Scotland, creating some uncertainty, although in theory someone could be prosecuted under homicide legislation. There have already been several attempts to legalise assisted dying, but these have been rejected. The Commission on Assisted Dying, established and funded by campaigners who have been calling for a change in the law, concluded in 2012 that there was a \"strong case\" for allowing assisted suicide for people who are terminally ill in England and Wales. But the medical profession and disability rights groups, among others, argue that the law should not be changed because it is there to protect the vulnerable in society. In other countries, such as Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, legislation has been introduced to allow assisted dying. France is considering a possible introduction of similar legislation, although there is opposition from its medical ethics council. Campaign group Dignity in Dying predicts that a lot more countries will follow suit. However, the current Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, regards the Assisted Dying Bill as \"mistaken and dangerous\" and the Church of England (CofE) wants to see an inquiry into the issue. The Church said a Royal Commission would include expert opinion and could carefully assess the various arguments. It believes the current bill should be withdrawn to allow that inquiry to take place - a call rejected by Lord Falconer, the Labour peer who tabled it.

The code's advice included asking retailers to warn passengers not to consume duty-free purchases on the plane, while staff are also asked not to sell alcohol to passengers who appear drunk. Panorama found more than a quarter of cabin crew surveyed were unaware of the code of practice and, of those who had heard of it, only 23% thought it was working.

Mr Modi is here to make sure it continues to do so for decades to come, but perhaps now with more benefit to those back home. His visit, which was welcomed by more than 20,000 expats on Sunday evening at a stadium reception in San Jose, comes at a time when Indian and Indian-American success in Silicon Valley is truly formidable. There's the charismatic Satya Nadella in charge at Microsoft. There's the 10-year-strong reign of Shantanu Narayen at the top of Adobe. And more recently, Sundar Pichai took over as chief executive of Google - a role many said had been years coming. Indians in California say it's the blend of temperament and competitive spirit that brings success their way. \"If an old school friend starts a company in Silicon Valley,\" one Valley-based Indian tech executive, Mohit Aron, told me, \"I'm going to start an even better one\". Mr Modi continues to ride the strong waves of support back home. A recent US think-tank study suggests 87% of Indians have \"favourable opinions\" of the leader. Outside the stadium, that enthusiasm was on full display - though not without the accompaniment of a strong protest against his government. Those not on \"Team Modi\" are angry at what they see as ignorance towards Mr Modi's past. In particular, they say he did little to prevent the killing of Muslims in the Gujarat riots in 2002. And when it comes to Digital India, Mr Modi's plans to get a billion more Indians on the internet, they say that's a front to mass surveillance. A letter, signed by more than 100 academics in Silicon Valley ahead of Mr Modi's visit, backed up this concern. They believe the positivity around his leadership, particularly in the Indian press, is more to do with aggression from the government towards its critics. Yet the support for Mr Modi in the US appeared genuine - and its his tech-savvy attitude to communicating that seems to impress people most. \"We're very proud,\" said one supporter outside the stadium. The SAP Center is in San Jose, a city that sits at the bottom of Silicon Valley, a region where Indians truly thrive. Some 26% of tech companies here are founded or run by Indians and Indian Americans. That's more than the next five immigrant groups combined. Mr Modi has come here on a mission to bring some of that success, and wealth, back to India. To do it, he needs help. Before India can even begin to think of itself as a genuinely major technology player, it needs to cover the basics. Mr Modi, effortlessly adopting Silicon Valley's obsession with buzzwords, said the country needs both highways and \"i-ways\", by which he meant fibre internet, connecting each and every Indian town and village. Earlier on Sunday, Mr Modi spent time with someone who could help, taking part in a Q&A with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. It was decidedly more A than Q, mind, as of 40,000 questions submitted to Mr Modi, only three were asked during the session. They covered the rewards of getting online, particularly when it comes to creating jobs. Mr Modi spoke of his delight at his tweets and messages to other world leaders \"going viral\". The last question, from Mr Zuckerberg, asked about Mr Modi's relationship with his mother. Pausing, Mr Modi became emotional as he told of cleaning dishes for those less fortunate. The prime minister even appeared to cry. An elderly Indian lady later told me it made her feel like he was \"just like us\". Those who see Mr Modi less favourably say that was exactly its intention, a staged display designed to build his reputation as a man of the people. The meeting at Facebook was mutually beneficial. Mr Zuckerberg, keen as ever to expand Facebook's user base and global influence, talked up the prospect of connecting a billion more Indians to the internet. In one of the most pointed exchanges in the entire session, Mr Modi said he hoped Mr Zuckerberg's motivations weren't purely about Facebook's bank balance. For Mr Modi, this entire Silicon Valley visit is a chance to put a little pressure on the tech giants. He wants India to graduate from being home to the low-end of the tech trade - call centres and cheap labour - and instead an attractive place to start a technology business. Indeed, he wants India to be a great place to start any kind of business, and reverse the trend of great minds, particularly in tech, heading to California. One parent outside the SAP Center, whose children were dressed in stunning, sparkling saris, said she believed when her girls grow up they will see moving back to India as a career aspiration - in the same way she saw the US as way to a better life.

The children gulped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun. \"They don't want us,\" he said, and gave his explanation of why his town of Yei, just 80km (50 miles) from the border, had become a place he had to leave. \"These tribes of Dinka, they don't want Equatorians, they don't want\u2026 Nuer. They don't want them.\" Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan. The civil war began as a dispute between the Dinka President Salva Kiir, and former Vice-President Riek Machar who is Nuer. Equatorians only started to be targeted in July, when the violence spread to their part of the country after rebel troops fled the capital. In a long line of people at a nearby refugee reception centre, Otima Amos, 21, explained how he had crossed the border after walking through the bush for many days with 16 other people - most children, and among them two-year-old twins.\"We walked up to here - without any other form of transport,\" he said. \"It was very hard because they were killing people. If you were a boy you would be killed, if you were a girl or a woman they would just rape you. If not, you would be killed.\" They were afraid they would be caught as they tried to escape. Uganda is coping extremely well with the huge influx of refugees. With the help of aid agencies, within 36 hours each family is allocated a 30m square patch of land and a tarpaulin to set up a shelter and start planting crops. Faida Sarah arrived in August with her children, but already has okra ready to harvest as well as onions, tomatoes and greens bursting out of the ground. The reason she left Yei was because one night soldiers came round to her home, demanded car keys from her husband and then hacked him to death just outside the house. In July Bidi Bidi was a village, but now it is one of the biggest refugee settlements in the world - home to more than a quarter of a million people and covering 250 square kilometres. But now home to nearly a million refugees, Uganda is beginning to struggle with its generous approach. \"This has been unrelenting since July,\" said Nasir Abel Fernandes, the UNHCR's senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda. \"The international community has to pay attention, and pressure the South Sudanese leaders to stop this, as it's a massacre of civilians from both sides.\" He says supplying water to the refugees is a problem, as it has to be trucked in.

The action should stop the tool from being able to infiltrate Apple's internet storage service if the safety measure is implemented. However, the security facility remains an opt-in choice. One expert suggested that Apple should instead make it the default option. The process works by introducing an extra step after an account holder has typed their username and password into a device they have not used before. They are also required to enter a four-digit code that is either texted to a trusted mobile phone number or sent via Apple's Find My iPhone app. If the person does not enter the code, they are refused access to iCloud and are blocked from making an iTunes, iBooks, or App Store purchase. They can, however, use a 14-character recovery key to regain access to the account in the event their trusted device is lost or stolen. They are told to keep this in a safe place to avoid being locked out. While Apple had offered the two-step verification system in the past, until now it had not come into play when device owners used the firm's back-up service. That meant that even if people had switched on the two-step feature to prevent cyber-thieves logging into their accounts with a stolen or guessed password, the attackers could still download a complete back-up of their data by using Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker. Several hackers' forums contain discussions about using of pirated copies of Elcomsoft's \"forensic\" software, which is marketed as a tool for law enforcement agencies to access iCloud content without needing to be in possession of a suspect's iPhone or iPad. ElmcomSoft's Moscow-based owner told the BBC earlier this month that he believed his software had been used in the recent hacks, as it was \"the only one able to do that\". He has now acknowledged that Apple's changes guard against the technique he had used. \"I think that implementation is secure, and so there is no workaround,\" Vladimir Katalov told the BBC, adding that his program could no longer even get a list of devices and back-ups linked to a user's account. \"The other security improvement, which I like, is that now the owner of the Apple account gets a notification by email immediately when a back-up starts downloading - whether or not two-factor authentication is enabled.\" However, he added that he still had concerns about Apple's security system. \"The recovery key is hard to remember. And as far as you are not going to use it frequently - it is not needed at all while you have the trusted device handy - there is a good chance that you lose it,\" he said. \"And if you lose your device too, there will be no way to get your data back. \"Secondly, the recovery key might be stolen. And someone who managed to get your Apple ID password and your security key could make a lot of trouble for you, not just downloading your selfies.\" But another security expert downplayed the risk of lost recovery keys, and said that Apple should do more than just recommend people switch on the two-factor test. \"We've seen so much in recent times that single-step verification - ie passwords - is vulnerable, we're at the stage that two-factor authentication should be the default,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey. \"It's a case of turn it on by default, and let people turn it off if they really don't want it. \"And that applies to not just Apple, but companies like Microsoft and Google too.\" Apple has told the Wall Street Journal that it \"plans to more aggressively encourage people\" to turn two-factor authentication on and use stronger passwords. \"When I step back from this terrible scenario that happened and say what more could we have done, I think about the awareness piece,\" chief executive Tim Cook told the newspaper. \"I think we have a responsibility to ratchet that up.

Mr Al-Jeffery has denied the allegations at the High Court. But Mr Justice Holman said she had been \"deprived of her liberty\" and her father must facilitate her return. Ms Al-Jeffery, who has dual nationality, says her father took the action against her will after she \"kissed a guy\". Delivering the court order, Mr Justice Holman said Mr Al-Jeffery \"must permit and facilitate the return of Amina if she so wishes to Wales or England and pay the airfare\" by 11 September. However, he accepted there was \"little or nothing this court could do\" to enforce the order if Mr Al-Jeffery \"was determined not to comply with it\". But he said Mr Al-Jeffery might face contempt of court proceedings if he returned to Britain without having complied. Mr Justice Holman added: \"There are no conventions between Britain and Saudi Arabia. The courts in Saudi Arabia would not even recognise the basis of the claim, because it does not recognise dual nationality.\" Her lawyer, Anne-Marie Hutchinson QC, said she has been unable to take instruction from Ms Al-Jeffery, who sent her emails in December 2015. She said she had been \"physically abused\" and there were times when she had not been allowed to leave her room, meaning she had to use it as a toilet. She described having her head smacked against the wall. Ms Hutchinson later told BBC Newsnight it had been a \"difficult\" but \"compelling\" case to work on. \"I'm absolutely delighted that the judge has said he has got jurisdiction and that he has gone on to exercise his jurisdiction and make orders. \"I'm expecting him [Mr Al-Jeffery,] to comply with the order,\" she said. Mr Al-Jeffery, who did not attend the case, denied his daughter wanted to return to England or Wales. He said he put up a barrier partition to stop her running away because he was concerned for her welfare, which was taken down on the advice of the authorities. He said he wanted to make sure Ms Al-Jeffery was safe and was not being mistreated. Neither Amina nor her father were in court to hear the ruling. And the question now is what difference a ruling in the High Court of England and Wales will make in Saudi Arabia. Mr Justice Holman said he accepted that there is \"little or nothing\" this court could do to enforce the order if Amina's father was determined not to obey or comply with it. Certainly the basis on which it was granted, that Amina has dual British and Saudi nationality, is not recognised in Saudi Arabia. And it is perhaps telling that Mohammed Al-Jeffery's legal costs have been paid for by the Saudi embassy. However, the judge stated that to do nothing \"would in my view amount to a dereliction towards Amina\". The court was told that in April Mr Al-Jeffery instigated legal proceedings against his daughter in Jeddah \"seeking parental control over his child for the purposes of caring and supervision\". Legal documentation showed both father and daughter agreed to a reconciliation. But Mr Justice Holman said that meant if \"she were to run away the police, far from offering her protection from her father, would put her in prison\". Mr Justice Holman said: \"If Amina chooses to remain voluntarily in Saudi Arabia she must of course adhere to the law and culture of that society but the current constraint is denying to her the ability to be British and to live in Britain. \"It is true that she is currently present and habitually resident in Saudi Arabia, but that is due to her obedience to her father in 2012. She did not travel there of her own free will.\" He said Mr Al-Jeffery \"voluntarily chose to live for many years in Wales, to educate and bring his children up here... and to accept the constraints of the legal system of England and Wales\". The judge said the fact Ms Al-Jeffery was born and brought up in Britain until she was almost 17 was a \"very significant factor\" in his decision. The court was told Mr Al-Jeffery's wife, from whom he is not estranged, and several of his children continue to live in the UK. Swansea West MP Geraint Davies has written to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to demand immediate action over the case. The former Swansea schoolgirl has been in touch with friends in the UK and asked them to contact the British Embassy to inform them of her situation, and has also sent a picture of what she claimed was the caged room her father had kept her in. In a statement, the Foreign Office said: \"We recognise that this is a distressing time for Ms Al-Jeffery. We have been providing assistance to her since the case was first brought to our attention and will continue to do so. \"British embassy staff have met with her to check on her welfare and helped her speak to lawyers in the UK.\"", "summary": "A woman who claims her father has kept her locked up against her will in Saudi Arabia must be allowed to return to Britain, a UK judge has ruled."}, {"text": "There is a general belief here that if you typed Ghana or Ghanaian into a search engine, the words that would be suggested automatically as a follow-up should be politics and football. It is these two subjects that spark animated discussions and get the juices flowing. Even though in football, we have not won anything on the continental or world stage for a very long time, we still believe that the Black Stars, our national team, are special. One of the inner sources of the strength that help Ghanaians survive is the fact that our national team regularly beats the national team of the United States at football. Trying to get a visa from Ghana to the United States is one of the most humiliating experiences for Ghanaians. But we are able to endure it all by simply repeating over and over again under our breaths: \"World Cup 2006, we defeated you, World Cup 2010, we defeated you.\" Now, we discovered quite unexpectedly that defeating the US at football has even deeper implications, when news broke that our government had accepted two Yemeni ex-detainees, Khalid al-Dhuby and Mahmoud Omar Bin Atef, from Guantanamo Bay, where the US detains terror suspects, to live in Ghana. Elizabeth Ohene: \"They are excited to come to Ghana because of Asamoah Gyan, the captain of the Black Star - they know him and they like him very much\" The government has struggled to explain this decision. We have been told the two men pose no danger whatsoever to Ghana; they were innocent 20-year-olds when they were arrested and to drive home their innocence, our president compares them to his own 20-year-old son. We have been told that even though the two men are such thoroughly harmless and nice people, their every move will be monitored. Normally taciturn officials from the US embassy are suddenly all over the radio and television trying to assure us we should all be proud of our government for bringing to Ghana men the US Senate deems too dangerous to enter their country. When none of these interventions appeared to be calming the protests, the two thoroughly harmless and nice men were brought out to state their own case on national radio. Guantanamo Bay prison: The pair said they do not belong to any terrorist group, and have been wrongly arrested for 14 years without any charge. They have suffered but are not looking for revenge. They want to live in Ghana quietly and peacefully, and put their lives together. All that did not sound very convincing to any of us here; what everybody really wanted to know was why they had been brought to Ghana - did they just pick us on the map because Ghana happens to be the physical centre of the world? And suddenly it all comes tumbling out. They are excited to come to Ghana because of Asamoah Gyan, the captain of the Black Stars, they know him and they like him very much. A lot of the detainees like Ghanaians very much, and during the 2010 World Cup, most of the people there in Guantanamo Bay - no, not most of them, all of them - were with Ghana and when the Black Stars beat America, they were very happy. So now we know... beating America at football has consequences. I am afraid I don't know what happened to our secret supporters in Guantanamo in 2014. They obviously did not cheer loud enough that year, which must be why we lost to the US. And for that reason alone, I think our two long-term visitors should be sent back to reorganize our supporters club in Guantanamo.

His rhetoric is too incendiary. Republican voters may be \"idiots\", but the general public is wiser. The US electoral map, which places a premium on winning key high-population \"swing\" states, is tilted against the Republican Party. About that last point. On Tuesday a survey of three key swing states - Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania - revealed a virtual dead heat between the two likely standard-bearers. Those states - which account for 67 electoral votes - all went for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Add them to the states Republican Mitt Romney carried in 2012, and it delivers 273 electoral votes - three more than the 270 necessary to win the presidency. Throw in a national tracking poll released on Wednesday that has Donald Trump surging to within striking distance of Hillary Clinton, and it's a recipe for acute hyperventilation on the part of Democrats. But\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 cooler-heads respond. The Reuters/Ipsos national poll, which has Mrs Clinton ahead 41% to Mr Trump's 40% and 19% undecided, was conducted online. That Quinnipiac swing-state poll oversampled white voters - a demographic group that is more inclined to Republicans. In addition, it doesn't represent that big a shift from the group's battleground-state poll from last autumn, which undermines the theory that Mr Trump's support is growing. The news caused election guru Nate Silver to go on a Twitter tirade, asserting that it's way too early to start gaming out the state-by-state electoral map based on opinion polls. \"The election will go through a lot of twists and turns, and polls are noisy,\" he writes. \"Don't sweat individual polls or short-term fluctuations.\" Sweating polls is what US pundits and commentators do, however. And at the very least, signs that Mr Trump is within reach of Mrs Clinton should cast doubts on the early predictions that the Democrats will win in the autumn by historic, Goldwater-esque margins. Mr Trump has a pathway to the presidency. He may not get there. It is not the most likely outcome. But it's real. That linchpin of a Trump victory centres on the so-called Rust Belt - states like the aforementioned Pennsylvania and Ohio, as well as Michigan and Wisconsin. Even if Florida, due to its rapidly growing Hispanic population, goes to Mrs Clinton, Mr Trump could still win if he sweeps those states. It's a strategy that Mr Trump already appears to understand. \"We'll win places that a lot of people say you're not going to win, that as a Republican you can't win,\" Mr Trump said at an April rally in Indiana. \"Michigan is a great example; nobody else will go to Michigan. We're going to be encamped in Michigan because I think I can win it.\" The challenge for Mr Trump is that the mid-west, particularly, Wisconsin and Michigan, have served as a Democratic firewall that Republicans have been unable to penetrate since 1988. \"These states constantly intrigue Republican presidential strategists because the Democratic advantage in them depends largely on an act of political levitation: the ability to consistently win a slightly greater share of working-class white voters here than almost anywhere else,\" writes the Atlantic's Ronald Brownstein. If Mr Trump is to find success, then, he likely will have to finally win over this stubborn portion of the mid-western electorate or, perhaps, energise what Sean Trende of RealClear Politics has called the \"missing white voters\". Trende points to a national drop-off more than 3.5 million white voters from the elections of 2008 to 2012, when population growth should have resulted in an increase of 1.5 million. These voters, he theorised, were largely working-class whites who had previously supported iconoclasts like Ross Perot, the 1992 anti-free-trade independent candidate. It's the type of voter that Mr Trump, with his populist economic pitch, has been turning out in the Republican primaries. In 2012 Mr Obama beat Mr Romney by roughly 5 million votes. If Mr Trump can bring those disaffected white voters back to the polls in 2016, it would cut into that margin. If Mrs Clinton is unable to produce the record-setting turnout among young and minority voters that Mr Obama achieved, the gap shrinks further still. That's a lot of \"if's\", of course. Young and minority voters - particularly Hispanics - may yet turn out to the polls in high numbers, if only to cast ballots against Mr Trump. There are already indications of record-setting Hispanic voter registration in places like California. There's also the risk that Mr Trump's reliance on populist rhetoric and controversial views on immigration could lead white-collar voters to favour Mrs Clinton. For every disaffected member of the working-class he brings in, he could lose a suburban mum or college-educated businessman. Even giving Mr Trump the benefit of the doubt, and viewing the recent polls as a trend and not a blip, there are still more electoral scenarios that end up with Mrs Clinton in the White House come 2017. For Mr Trump, the political stars have to re-align in his favour. For Mrs Clinton, a general-election status quo likely means victory.", "summary": "In the week since Donald Trump effectively secured the Republican presidential nomination, a great deal of ink and airtime have been devoted to explaining why he will have a difficult time winning the presidency in the autumn."}, {"text": "Assistant boss David Weir and sporting director Frank McParland will also depart the Bees, who are currently seventh in the Championship table.

He continued: \"In my remaining time at the club we shall move heaven and earth to get the promotion that the players, fans and Matthew deserve. \"I have enormous respect for Matthew and his investment in the club and he has the absolute right to run the club in the manner he deems most appropriate and beneficial. \"David and I remain totally focused on supporting this squad of players and ensuring they are best prepared for each and every remaining fixture this season.\" \"Clearly Mark Warburton felt he couldn't operate under the new \"European\" system which owner Matthew Benham wants to impose at Griffin Park.

He was not the only one to suffer at the hands of a teacher at a madrassa, an after school class where children learn about their faith. In the last year, three teachers from madrassas in Lancashire have been convicted of beating children, the latest case involving Patel. In August Kurram Hussain, also from Blackburn, was found guilty of what magistrates called \"gratuitous degradation\" in beating two boys aged 10 and 11. That followed Ibrahim Yusuf's conviction while teaching at an Accrington madrassa in 2011. The mother said police had told her that her son's teacher had punched him in the stomach and \"slapped his face, and hit his hands with a pencil\". \"And he made him stand like a chicken. If he fell down, after five minutes my boy said he made him do another five minutes.\" The stress position her son was forced to adopt is a torture tactic used in war zones. Corporal punishment has been banned in mainstream schools since the 1980s. However, madrassas are classed as supplementary schools where it is still legal in religious settings as long as it does not exceed \"reasonable chastisement\". The schools are unregulated and teachers often have no training. Nazir Afzal, the chief crown prosecutor for north-west England, handled all three prosecutions. He thinks abuse is far more widespread. \"When we talk about three successful prosecutions in the last year in the North West and probably a dozen nationally, we're talking about literally the tip of the iceberg,\" he said. \"In order to meet the demand, schools are being set up left right and centre. \"There is no Ofsted, no inspection regime, they're reliant entirely on a particular committee enforcing standards, ensuring discipline is correctly maintained. \"And if they are not up to the job, there's nothing to prevent children being harmed pretty much on a daily basis.\" One school leading the way in the reform is Jamia Ghosia Academy in Blackburn. It has become more like mainstream schools and is seen as a model of good practice by teachers at madrasssas in other parts of the country. Classes are small and interactive, staff are checked for criminal records, CCTV is in place to protect pupils and corporal punishment is banned. Head teacher Ustad Muhammad said: \"In terms of corporal punishment, I'm not going to accept that in any form or any way because no child learns with that. \"You have to be patient. Children can be rowdy, can shout, can do certain things but that's the whole idea of having teacher training and learning certain types of skills.\"", "summary": "An Islamic watchdog is calling for the reform of madrassas following the latest conviction of a teacher for child cruelty."}, {"text": "At the time Mr Tilli was working as an estate agent, but with the Portuguese housing market in free fall, he was earning next to nothing. And with Portugal's government needing a 78bn euro ($103bn; \u00c2\u00a362bn) international bailout, in exchange for putting in place a number of austerity measures, the wider Portuguese economy was mired in its worst recession for more than 40 years. With the jobs market having ground to a halt, and four children to look after, Magda and Miguel Tilli decided they had no option but to take a chance on starting their own company. Ms Tilli, 37, recalls: \"We were at the beach, brainstorming about what we could do.\" Tapping into Mr Tilli's knowledge of the property market, they recognised that they could turn a problem - no one was buying homes anymore - into a business opportunity. And so, they decided to launch an estate agent business specialising in renting houses in Lisbon city centre. While such a focus on rental properties may be common in other countries, the great majority of Portuguese estate agents only deal with selling homes. This is because in Portugal owning your own house or apartment has always been such a matter of pride that it is the first choice of most people, even young adults. Yet suddenly the great majority of young people couldn't hope to get a mortgage. Instead, a growing number living in Lisbon started to turn to the Tillis' new property rental business - Home Lovers. To keep start-up costs down, the couple initially listed their available properties only on Facebook. Yet to build up a decent reputation, they hired professionals to take all the photos, and only accepted properties of a high standard. Ms Tilli says they picked the kind of places that appeal to young, urban professionals, such as trendy apartments. Soon they had a steady stream of customers, both people wishing to rent a property, and landlords wanting to list with them. \"It became a cool thing to rent a house through us,\" says Ms Tilli, who previously worked as a flight attendant for TAP, the main Portuguese airline. Home Lovers has now expanded to Porto and Cascais, two other Portuguese cities, and has a team of 20 workers. It is now considering going to Madrid. Ms Tilli says: \"I'm a bit scared with that, but I don't see us being able to do this in any more places here in Portugal.\" To understand why entrepreneurship, or setting up a business, is now so popular in Portugal, you only need a quick reminder of how bad unemployment remains in the country, even though it came out of recession in 2013. The Portuguese jobless rate rose from 7.6% in 2008 to 14.1% in June of this year. The situation is even worse for young adults, with one out of every three people aged 15 to 24 years old out of work, according to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. Professor Paulo Soares de Pinho, who teaches at Nova School of Business and Economics in Lisbon, and runs his own investment fund, says that one of the biggest changes brought by Portugal's economic crisis was \"to transform many unemployed people into wannabe entrepreneurs\". Yet he cautions that while many technology-minded young people are coming up with products, not all of them are able to turn them into a viable business. \"We're going through an app entrepreneurship wave. Any kid coming out of an engineering school develops an app and thinks he has a company,\" he says. \"But there are many tech projects with no market orientation whatsoever.\" Carlos Silva, co-founder of the crowd funding website Seedrs, agrees that in Portugal \"may start-ups are going ahead just because entrepreneurship is now a trend\". Yet, he adds that there are \"more and more start-ups of excellent quality.\" To help boost entrepreneurship, the Portuguese government has created an investment body called Portugal Ventures to invest 20m euros of public funds a year into start-up firms. Start-up incubators have also sprung up, to give new businesses an office or desk to help them get on their feet during their first months. Magda and Miguel Tilli, used one such incubator - Start-up Lisboa - during the launch of their firm. Anthony Douglas is another entrepreneur who has used Start-up Lisboa to get his business off the ground. The 33-year-old is the founder of Hole19, a golfing app, which has mapped out thousands of golf courses around the world, and allows golfers to track and store statistics about their own performances. Initially it was a paid app, and the business struggled. Mr Douglas, who has a Portuguese mother and American father, says: \"We've been almost dead a few times, with zero euros in the bank. \"In some months I stopped paying my own salary and had to ask relatives for money.\" Yet Mr Douglas has since been able to transform the business's fortunes by giving the app away for free. The aim is now to make money by enabling Hole19's users to book golf courses via the app, in exchange for paying a fee each time. Mr Douglas says Hole19 was downloaded 220,000 times in the first 90 days after going free. And recently he raised 900,000 euros from foreign investors. Joao Romao, 25, is another young Portuguese entrepreneur who has managed to turn around his business fortunes. His first start-up venture, based around the idea of a shareable gift list connected to online shops, quickly failed. Undeterred, he is now developing a business called GetSocial, which aims to help companies promote their content on social networks, and measure its impact. Recently he secured 630,000 euros of investment. Mr Romao says: \"The first try was a good lesson learned. It taught me how to build a start-up. Everybody's learning.\"", "summary": "When Portugal was hit by an economic crisis in 2011, Magda Tilli and her husband Miguel realised that if they wanted to make a decent living they would have to set up their own business."}, {"text": "A close-range Joseph Mendes finish put the Royals ahead and Jordan Obita's intended cross doubled the lead.

The oval shape of eggs and the boxes required to keep them intact means that, compared to the amount of space they take up in a shipping container, it is impossible for Montezuma's to charge the end customer enough to make a decent profit. Foreign sales account for about a fifth of the company's overall sales and for this financial year, ending in May, it expects exports to hit the \u00a31m mark for the first time. Despite the strong demand from abroad, the firm is yet to send its chocolate eggs overseas. \"The economics just haven't added up so far,\" says Mrs Pattinson, who co-founded the firm in 2000 with her husband Simon. The company has six shops in the South East of England and sells directly to customers in the US and Europe via its website, and further afield via export arrangements. So far most of its overseas customers have come via a partnership deal with a large US retailer. Despite the more established reputation of Swiss and Belgian chocolatiers, Mrs Pattinson says she is seeing a growing demand for British-made chocolate. \"The most contemporary artisan foodies are beginning to realise Britain is a fantastic producer of chocolate,\" she says. Last year, the UK exported a whopping \u00a3245m worth of chocolate, up by almost a quarter on 2015. Exports of unfilled chocolates and chocolate products, which include Easter eggs, totalled just over \u00a330m, up 3% on 2015. While the vast majority of these went to EU countries, the biggest growth was in exports to non-EU countries which increased by almost a fifth, according to the Department for International Trade. It is a trend that hasn't escaped the notice of Sean Ramsden, chief executive of Ramsden International. The family firm specialises in exporting British food overseas and Mr Ramsden says Easter is its busiest period after Christmas. The awkward shape of chocolate eggs isn't a problem for the company because it supplies a much wider range of products, enabling it to mix Easter eggs with other food orders. \"Easter eggs are a popular UK product and they're very exportable. They [Easter eggs] are not as advanced in other countries,\" he says. When the Grimsby-based firm first started exporting in 1970, business was largely driven by expats. Marmite, brown sauce and baked beans were the items most in demand in the company's markets in Spain, Portugal, France, Canada, Australia and Hong Kong. Now it delivers to 130 countries and turnover last year was \u00a350m. Mr Ramsden says the company's growth reflects demand from a growing global middle class. \"The food becomes premium by virtue of being imported. There is an element of snob value in certain markets,\" he says. Particularly in Asia, he says, customers are keen to have \"something a little bit different or a bit more exclusive\" such as a foreign brand. But he says many of its customers also have an international outlook, with second homes in the UK, for example, and a genuine affection for British food. Sharan Gill, who lives in Hong Kong, says she always buys imported chocolate eggs for her children at Easter. \"It's a tradition amongst my friends too, both Western and Asian. I spend between 100 to 150 Hong Kong dollars (\u00a310-\u00a315; $13-$19) on chocolates for the annual Easter egg hunt, which my kids thoroughly enjoy. \"Easter seems to be a growing trend, partly because clubs and restaurants promote it extensively. \"Plus Hong Kong has a large expat community, a large proportion of which consists of Westerners, for whom Easter is an established tradition. It is also celebrated by the predominantly Catholic Filipino community who form a large part of the domestic helper workforce,\" she says. The fervour surrounding the Christian festival has reached such fever pitch that the home and lifestyle gurus at Good Housekeeping magazine recently declared the occasion \"a second Christmas\". Theresa May criticises Cadbury over Easter egg hunt Co-op's 'Treat your daughter' Easter egg adverts changed It is not just small firms benefiting from the growing sense of occasion. Marks and Spencer says it exports a number of its popular eggs to its 468 shops overseas, with them selling particularly well in Hong Kong, Western Europe and the Czech Republic. \"We're seeing double-digit growth on sales of our Easter eggs internationally - with people buying into both our large 'giftable' eggs as well as impulse purchasing small bags of chocolate foiled eggs and bigger bags of eggs for Easter egg hunts - an event which is increasing in popularity,\" says a spokeswoman. People really like the licensed character eggs and Star Wars' R2D2 is currently the best seller internationally, she adds. While market research firm Mintel doesn't track British chocolate exports, its figures show people around the world are eating more chocolate eggs. \"In Brazil, for example, the trade association ABICAB reported that 95 million chocolate Easter eggs were sold in 2016, a 19% increase over 2015. In that country, Easter eggs make up a major percentage of annual chocolate revenues,\" says global food and drink analyst Marcia Mogelonsky. \"In Ireland, consumers spent more than 40m euros (\u00a334m; $42m) on Easter eggs in 2016, while the UK Easter egg market was valued at \u00a3220m.\" It is a market that Montezuma's Mrs Pattinson is obviously keen to exploit. \"It's about putting our new product development heads on to find ones that don't have so much air inside,\" she laughs.", "summary": "Cracking open a large chocolate egg to find nothing in the middle is one of life's perennial disappointments."}, {"text": "But this is where you find the alleged mastermind of Turkey's failed coup, the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen. And he has broken his customary seclusion to give rare interviews defending himself against the accusations levelled by his nemesis, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Who was behind Turkey coup attempt? Turkey police and officials purged How mobiles beat tanks and saved Erdogan We were greeted at the Golden Generation Worship & Retreat Center by polite, well-spoken men who serve as the first line of gate-keepers to the revered preacher and writer. They belong to organisations inspired by Mr Gulen, not run by him, a testament to the strength of his personality and the appeal of his message. He advocates a Sufi-based Islam of tolerance that emphasises education and promotes business. In Turkey, though, critics view this style of leadership as a threat, saying he wields much unelected political influence through followers who have heavily penetrated the bureaucracy and have links to media and business. The retreat sprawls over 25 lush green acres (10 hectares) in the foothills of the Poconus Mountains. But the cleric, it was emphasised, occupies only a single, spartan bedroom in one of the buildings. We were shown a desk, a small bed and a small mat. He met us in an adjacent room, seated beneath a framed admonition to \"Continue to Love\", written in Arabic calligraphy. He rose to greet us but his strength failed him and he fell back onto the sofa. The real gatekeeper is Mr Gulen's doctor, who gave him medication so he could manage the interview. Although his heart condition and diabetes have made him very frail, his language was anything but. He condemned the coup attempt as treason, claiming that \"even if at the helm of the country there are people who would like to replace me and suppress me and oppress me at the level of blood-sucking vampires, even then I do not want to remove them with anti-democratic means\". \"This is my attitude toward any and even the idea of the consideration of a military coup.\" It may be that he sees President Erdogen as a vampire after his blood. The two men once banded together to curb the power of Turkey's secular military. But a few years ago Mr Erdogan became suspicious that Mr Gulen's followers were driving a corruption investigation that targeted his inner circle. He moved to stamp out any alternative power centre, even if it was another Islamic one. Since then he has been purging them from state institutions. Mr Gulen called this a \"witch-hunt\" which accelerated after the failed coup. \"It's not possible to talk about democracy any more,\" he said of reported excesses. \"This kind of regime resembles more of a clan and a tribal administration.\" Without naming Mr Erdogan, he compared him to dictators such as Hitler and Saddam Hussein. But he counselled his followers to remain peaceful because \"society is already polarised enough, don't make it worse\". Ironically Mr Gulen fled to America in 1999 amid accusations of trying to overthrow the secular government. Now it is an Islamist one demanding that the US send him back. He seemed unfazed by Mr Erdogan's plan to lodge a formal extradition request. He declared it would be politically motivated rather than legally sound, and therefore would not get much attention in a country where \"the rule of law reigns supreme\". The issue, however, is getting much attention: already it's led to some sharp exchanges between Turkish and American officials. And it could create further headaches for the US government, especially if the evidence provided does not stand up in an American court. Once again Mr Gulen sought to rise above the political to the spiritual. \"I will die one day,\" he said. \"Whether I die in my bed or in prison I don't care.\"", "summary": "Rural Pennsylvania is not the sort of place you would think to look for someone accused of throwing the Middle East into further turmoil."}, {"text": "Microsoft has revealed details of a login system for the next version of Windows based around pictures a user stores on a touchscreen device. Only when parts of an image are tapped or touched in the right order will a user be able to access a device. Experts said it might stop people using weak passwords but could lead to other loopholes that are harder to solve. Microsoft aired the idea of using images to sign on to a device via a blog written by engineers working on Windows 8 - the next version of the Windows operating system expected to be released in late 2012. Windows 8 is designed for touchscreen devices such as tablets and the novel sign-on systems makes use of the sensitive displays they are likely to sport. The familiar process of getting to use a desktop PC or laptop by typing in a password made of up lower and upper case letters as well as numbers was felt to be too \"cumbersome\" for tablets,wrote Microsoft engineer Zach Pace on the blog. The replacement system proposed by Microsoft employs a picture chosen by a user from their collection of images on a device. On this image, users are encouraged to tap on, underline or circle the parts that are important to them. The sequence of gestures, including start and end positions and orientation act as a key to unlock the device. User-testing suggests that the image-based system can grant access to a portable gadget far faster than was possible through text-based passwords, wrote Mr Pace. He stressed that the system would work alongside text-based passwords rather than replace them. If a user failed to properly reproduce the correct gestures fives times in a row they would be prompted for the password they set up when they first used the device. The permutations of taps, touches and circles that could be drawn on a picture was likely to be far higher than those available from text-based passwords, said Prof Alan Woodward from the department of computing at the University of Surrey. That was especially true, he said, when one considered the limited number of words from which most people picked their passwords. \"The initial calculations show that it is likely to provide a level of security that is at least as strong as a password, and frankly, stronger than most passwords chosen by users,\" he added. Graham Cluley, senior security researcher at Sophos, said the research was \"interesting and cute\" but may introduce other security problems. It could, he said, make people vulnerable to \"shoulder surfing\" - a practice better known from cash machines where crooks try to spot a victim's Pin as they tap it into a number pad. \"With normal password entry, what you're doing is asterisked on the screen,\" said Mr Cluley. \"With this gesture input, folks may find it easier to see the movements you are making.\" There might be more value in operating systems encouraging people to use stronger passwords by refusing to let them use dictionary words or ones that are easy to crack, he added.", "summary": "Using Windows 8 devices could involve signing on by tapping, circling or touching images."}, {"text": "The Bayern Munich player was not hurt but appeared shaken after the incident early in the second half, which forced play to be stopped for several minutes.

The group was blamed for a magnitude 5.9 earthquake after stripping on Mount Kinabalu, which is considered sacred. They were jailed for three days, but their sentences were back-dated to reflect time already served. A judge at Kota Kinabalu Magistrates' Court said the four had shown remorse and ordered the jail terms to run from 9 June, meaning the group is free to leave. He also fined each defendant 5,000 Malaysian ringgit (\u00c2\u00a3860/$1,330). The BBC's Jennifer Pak, who was in court, said she understood the group were now waiting to pay their fines before being deported. Hawkins' lawyer Ronny Cham said the 23-year-old, from Draycott in Derbyshire, would be freed from police custody later on Friday and her release documentation was being arranged. She would then fly home to the UK on Saturday, her lawyer said. Her father Timothy Hawkins said the sentence was \"appropriate and fair\" but it appeared she had been \"treated pretty badly\" amid the media scrum outside court. \"She's obviously very traumatised,\" he said. \"Eleanor knows what she did was wrong and disrespectful and she is deeply sorry for any offence she has caused to the Malaysian people.\" Foreign coverage of the story has been criticised in the Malaysian press. Several local newspapers accused British tabloids of exaggerating reports that the tourists were arrested for causing the quake, rather than the actual charge of public indecency. The Sabah-based Daily Express accused the papers of running \"sensational\" headlines, while the country's most popular English-language paper, The Star, said reports (pictured) alleging Hawkins and the others were arrested for angering mountain gods \"couldn't be further from the truth\". Tourism minister, Masidi Manjun, said their acts would have merited punishment for breaking local laws and norms whether or not the earthquake took place. Mr Masidi, who comes from the foothills of Mount Kinabalu, was also quoted in the Malay Mail as saying there had been some \"fact-twisting\" by foreign media. \"I don't know whether this is on purpose just to ridicule us, or their failure to appreciate our local traditions and customs,\" he said. Speaking to reporters outside his home, Mr Hawkins said the family were looking forward to his daughter's return. \"We do not know when this will be as we've had no contact from the High Consulate in Malaysia, and we've not spoken to Ellie,\" he said. She and her co-accused all admitted a charge of \"committing an obscene act in public\". Prosecutors said the four tourists, along with six others, climbed the peak to enjoy the sunrise on 30 May and then challenged each other to take off their clothes. But the court amended the facts to agree the accused did not tell the guide to \"shut up\" or \"go to hell\", as the prosecution had alleged. Their lawyer said they had simply ignored pleas not to remove their clothes, and had not verbally abused the guide. Mr Cham, who representing all four defendants, said they were ignorant of local customs and \"their act had brought shame and ridicule upon themselves and their respective countries\". He asked the judge to not make an example of them, saying the intense international media coverage had traumatised them enough. The prosecution argued the public interest was central to the case and, according to Malaysian law, anyone committing an \"obscene act\" which causes annoyance in a public place should be jailed for up to three months.

He denied three other offences. Denning, who was arrested in a police inquiry into the Walton Hop Disco for teenagers in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, will be sentenced on 6 October. He was part of the original line-up that launched Radio 1 in 1967, but left two years later. The prosecution said it did not intend to proceed with a trial on the three charges to which Denning had pleaded not guilty. He is currently serving a 13-year jail term for sexual assaults against 24 victims aged nine to 16 from the 1960s to 1980s. He will be sentenced at Southwark Crown Court by the same judge who jailed him for those offences in 2014. The latest offences Denning admitted included indecent assaults on men and boys and inciting boys aged under 16 and 14 to commit acts of gross indecency. The offences he denied were three counts of indecent assault. Surrey Police said the case against the former DJ formed was part of its Operation Ravine investigation into non-recent sexual offences linked to the Walton Hop Disco which ran between 1958 and 2001. Det Ch Ins Jo Hayes said: \"Denning, who was looked up to and sometimes idolised by many young people, has used his status to prey on innocent children which he has now admitted to.\" Four of Denning's victims were in court to see him plead guilty. Det Ch Insp Hayes said: \"The four boys who Denning abused had moved on with their lives and were now adult men with families and careers. Often, they had not spoken to those closest to them about their ordeal as a child and only recently, as part of this investigation, have been able to do so... \"We can never go back and take away the abuse these four men suffered as boys but I hope, in some way, today's guilty plea brings some closure for them.\" Chris Denning rose to prominence in the 1960s on BBC television and radio. He was one of the first announcers heard on BBC Two when the channel began broadcasting in 1964 and went on to be one of the original Radio 1 DJs. Denning helped launch the careers of the Bay City Rollers and Gary Glitter, and ran his own music and video production business. He remained a well-known DJ and presenter into the early 1970s. The allegations that led to his conviction in 2014 arose after the sex abuse perpetrated by late Radio 1 DJ Jimmy Savile came to light. Denning's arrest was under the strand of the investigation into offences not connected to Savile, but the court heard he did use his fame to \"entice\" boys. This included taking some victims to recordings of Top of the Pops, and in other instances, introducing them to celebrities including Savile. Denning had a number of previous convictions for abusing young boys. In 1974, he was convicted of gross indecency and indecent assault but was not imprisoned. He was then jailed for 18 months in 1985 for gross indecency, and in 1988 he received a three-year sentence, this time for indecent assault and possession of indecent images. In 1996, he was handed a 10-week sentence for publishing indecent articles. He was arrested in the Czech Republic in 1997 and eventually jailed in 2000 by a Prague court for four and a half years for having sexual contact with underage teenage boys. The UK tried and failed to have Denning extradited from the Czech Republic, but in 2005 he was arrested at Heathrow Airport, having arrived from Austria. In January 2006, a British court jailed him for four years after he admitted five charges of indecent assault on boys under 16 during the 1970s and 80s. He was then extradited to Slovakia, where he was given a five-year sentence in 2008 for producing indecent images of children.", "summary": "Former BBC DJ Chris Denning has pleaded guilty to 21 child sex offences committed between 1969 and 1986."}, {"text": "From her early days as a prodigious youngster, the career-threatening injury, the comeback and first world title to the iconic gold at London 2012. Then came Ennis-Hill the mum, a second world title and her final act, a silver at Rio. Minichiello has seen it all and tells BBC Sport why the \"hard-working mum\" deserves her place as Britain's greatest ever athlete. \"How would I describe Jess in three words? A hard-working mum. \"Leading into London she was an athlete first and foremost. But after her son Reggie was born she was a mum who did athletics. That is a lovely example, look at her, how she changed, she became just a mum with a hobby. \"The World Championship medal in 2015 and the Olympic medal at Rio was more about doing something for her son; her son would see that and have an affinity with it. He is very sporty, and can throw a broom handle thinking it's a javelin. \"He has seen his mum, whatever memory he may or may not have, he will have experienced what his mum's reputation will always be.\" Media playback is not supported on this device \"I met Jess when she was nine. I was teaching on summer camps at the time and I saw this kid who stood out from her peers because she was just that bit quicker. \"She only came down because her friend came down but she stuck with it and the friend went in a different direction. \"Jess kept exceeding and exceeding expectations, people criticised her for being too small, said she'd never make it. They said my coaching was no good. But I was like 'no, come and see this kid, what she does, she is tenacious, a highly-competitive individual'. \"She can be a pain, she is always ultra competitive. She gets it from her mum, even lobbing a drinks bottle into a bin from five metres. \"Her best quality is her ability to be ultra competitive but be incredibly grounded and modest. She is critical of herself. She does not say 'look at me, the great I am'. She is modest and strives to be better and has an incredible work ethic. You could not ask for any more. She got her physicality from her parents and add that to the work ethic and competitive bit; bring all that together and you have lightning in a bottle. \"She has always been sassy and was a cheeky little kid. But she has that determination to do better and never be satisfied with her performance.\" Media playback is not supported on this device \"For me, the highlight of her career wasn't London 2012, but coming back from pregnancy and winning the World Championship in Beijing in 2015. \"Number two would coming back from three stress fractures in her foot and winning her first World Championship in 2009 because that was potentially a career-threatening injury. The home Olympics was big but in my perspective overcoming adversity was better. \"London was superb, but a bit surreal because the crowd were so supportive. It wasn't quite the same pressurised environment. Normally on the first day of a heptathlon it is three men a dog, but it was packed. \"I have two great memories from London. The first was when she was introduced in the last heat of the 800m. They went down the line and when the announcer got to lane eight - Jess' lane - he was drowned out by the noise of the crowd. \"The second was so many people staying in the stadium for the medal ceremony and singing the national anthem.

She came to public attention in 2009 by writing a diary for BBC Urdu about life under Taliban militants who had taken control of the valley. A Pakistani Taliban spokesman told the BBC they carried out the attack. Ehsanullah Ehsan told BBC Urdu that they attacked her because she was anti-Taliban and secular, adding that she would not be spared. Malala Yousafzai was travelling with at least one other girl when she was shot, but there are differing accounts of how events unfolded. By Orla GuerinBBC News, Islamabad The chilling attack on the young peace campaigner has been leading TV news bulletins here. Malala Yousafzai is one of the best-known schoolgirls in the country. Young as she is, she has dared to do what many others do not - publicly criticise the Taliban. Malala's confident, articulate campaign for girls' education has won her admirers - and recognition - at home and abroad. She has appeared on national and international television, and spoken of her dream of a future Pakistan where education would prevail. Even by the standards of blood-soaked Pakistan, there has been shock at the shooting. It has been condemned by Pakistan's Prime Minister, Raja Pervez Ashraf, who sent a helicopter to transfer Malala to hospital in Peshawar. The head of Pakistan's Independent Human Rights Commission, Zohra Yusuf, said \"this tragic attack on this courageous child\" sends a very disturbing message to all those working for women and girls. One report, citing local sources, says a bearded gunman stopped a car full of schoolgirls, and asked for Malala Yousafzai by name, before opening fire. But a police official also told BBC Urdu that unidentified gunmen opened fire on the schoolgirls as they were about to board a van or bus. She was hit in the head and, some reports say, in the neck area by a second bullet, but is now in hospital and is reportedly out of danger. Another girl who was with her at the time was also injured. Malala Yousafzai was just 11 when she was writing her diary, two years after the Taliban took over the Swat Valley, and ordered girls' schools to close. In the diary, which she kept for the BBC's Urdu service under a pen name, she exposed the suffering caused by the militants as they ruled. She used the pen-name Gul Makai when writing the diary. Her identity only emerged after the Taliban were driven out of Swat and she later won a national award for bravery and was also nominated for an international children's peace award. Correspondents say she earned the admiration of many across Pakistan for her courage in speaking out about life under the brutal rule of Taliban militants. One poignant entry reflects on the Taliban decree banning girls' education: \"Since today was the last day of our school, we decided to play in the playground a bit longer. I am of the view that the school will one day reopen but while leaving I looked at the building as if I would not come here again.\" She has since said that she wants to study law and enter politics when she grows up. \"I dreamt of a country where education would prevail,\" she said. The BBC's Orla Guerin in Islamabad says that Malala Yousafzai was a public figure who didn't shy away from risks and had strong support from her parents for her activism. Indeed, her father, who is a school teacher, expressed his pride in her campaigning. In a statement about the attack, Pakistani Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf said: \"We have to fight the mindset that is involved in this. We have to condemn it... Malala is like my daughter, and yours too. If that mindset prevails, then whose daughter would be safe?\" After the Taliban: Swat women on changing life The Taliban, under the notorious militant cleric Maulana Fazlullah, took hold of the Swat Valley in late 2007 and remained in de facto control until they were driven out by Pakistani military forces during an offensive in 2009. While in power they closed girls' schools, promulgated their extreme version of Sharia law and introduced measures such as banning the playing of music in cars. Since they were ejected, there have been isolated militant attacks in Swat but the region has largely remained stable and many of the thousands of people who fled during the Taliban years have returned.", "summary": "Gunmen have wounded a 14-year-old rights activist who has campaigned for girls' education in the Swat Valley in north-west Pakistan."}, {"text": "But with no private company yet to get a craft with passengers onboard into orbit, or even sub-orbit, how can you best endeavour to lead an industry that is still very much in an embryonic state? Final Frontier's cramped headquarters are testament to the very early stage of its business sector. It is based in a tiny studio in Brooklyn Navy Yard that can barely fit co-founders Ted Southern and Nikolay Moiseev, two assistants, and a few tables. Bits of fabric and plastic tubing litter almost every available surface. However, humble surroundings have not stopped the company from dreaming big about the future possibilities - and profits - of commercial space travel, which has already seen more than $1.4bn (\u00c2\u00a3900m) of investment from companies including Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic. And that figure is expected to more than double over the next 10 years as commercial space tourism is set to become a reality. Mr Moiseev, a former space suit designer for Zvezda, Russia's national space suit supplier, left his home country to strike out in the US. He has tried on and tested almost every space suit ever designed, and was responsible for designing the suits worn by cosmonauts on Mir, the former Russian space station, and the crew of the current International Space Station. But Mr Moiseev thinks that those designs are nothing compared with what lies ahead. \"In the near future a lot of people - tourists - any age, with different health conditions, will fly in space,\" he says. \"And the high operation pressure is a challenge for the space suit designer.\" This is the issue that Final Frontier says it is hoping to solve: how to design a space suit, not for an astronaut, but for a normal person who just happens to be headed to outer space. Mr Southern says: \"Spaceflight is notoriously uncomfortable - tight, hot - and sometimes the spacesuits just make it worse. \"When they're pressurised they're hard to move, you need special liquid cooling garments generally for space suits, and they cost hundreds of thousands of dollars,\" says Mr Southern. \"So that's what we're trying to overcome here, we're going for a suit that's lightweight, inexpensive, safe and also more comfortable than traditionally military style spacesuits.\" But first there's the small matter of money. Mr Southern says: \"A lot of rocket companies that are coming online now are hoping to fly 2014, 2015, 2016 - years out. \"So it's been a challenge for that reason finding funding, finding partners, and finding customers.\" Although the pair first started dreaming and designing in 2007, after meeting at a Nasa-sponsored astronaut glove design competition (which they later placed at in 2009), they did not set up Final Frontier until 2010. At first, Mr Southern poured in his extra earnings from his day job as a costume designer for Broadway shows and circus firm Cirque de Soleil, into the business. \"People always raise an eyebrow - 'Wow that's so different - props and costumes and spacesuits',\" says Mr Southern with a smile. \"In fact I see a full continuum there. Failure was not an option on Broadway either.\" Contracts with Nasa - to design radiation coating for fabrics and bits of space suits, including a pressurised elbow-and-shoulder assembly - provided Final Frontier with funding. As did an agreement with zero2infinity, a Spanish company interested in exploring suborbital trips. But in addition to traditional means, in June 2012 Final Frontier Design turned to crowd-funding website Kickstarter. Using the $27,632 they raised on the site, they were able to build the \"3G\" suit, which is the third version of their lightweight space suit. Meant to be worn inside the space capsule in case of a loss of pressure, it was unveiled this summer. Funding is not the only challenge: Final Frontier must also deal with competitors. There are the established space suit manufacturers, like David Clark and Boeing, who have a long history of providing suits for Nasa. Then, there are rival start-ups like Orbital Outfitters, which like Final Frontier features a founding team that includes space outsiders, such as a former Hollywood special effects artist. Finally, there are the in-house space suit design centres at a number of the commercial space tourism companies, such as SpaceX, which is led by Elon Musk, the founder of PayPal. Peter Homer, a private astronaut glove developer who started his own firm, Flagsuit (tagline: \"Fits like a glove\"), says there's more than enough room for everyone. \"Right now, there's not a lot of competition because there's no market,\" says Mr Homer, who is also collaborating with Orbital Outfitters. Mr Homer won the Nasa glove competition in 2007 and 2009. \"It's about trying to keep going and trying to keep moving the technology forward. I and others are kind of waiting for the customers to be ready for their space suits.\" So Mr Southern and Mr Moiseev continue to wait, and build. They've hired interns for the summer, who are busy testing various suit fabrics and gloves. For Mr Southern and Mr Moiseev, their unlikely partnership and even more implausible business quest, is not just about a business opportunity but also about the way they see the future. \"I see it as inevitable that the human race will expand beyond the surface of the Earth, it's unfortunately finite limited surface area here,\" says Mr Southern. \"I think it's pretty critical that we survive in these challenging environments.\"", "summary": "Final Frontier Design wants to be the number one space suit designer for commercial space flights."}, {"text": "Stead curled home with 14 minutes remaining to cap a fine comeback at the Northern Gas and Power Stadium after Louis Lang cancelled out Toto Nsiala's opener.

We don't mention pay day loans but it's implied,\" he said. \"It's not a faithful view of Victorian London. It's a subtle piece of writing that allows all sorts of elements in to make it more relevant. \"At the beginning of the play Scrooge presents himself as someone who's rather smooth and into marketing. He presents a benevolent front to the world so he can carry out his financial activities. \" The play is written by Patrick Barlow, with whom Broadbent performed for many years in the cult comedy troupe The National Theatre of Brent. And the small cast - including actors Adeel Akhtar, Amelia Bullmore, Keir Charles and Samantha Spiro - play multiples roles alongside some ingenious and heart-rending puppetry. Playwright Barlow said it had been a joy to bring Broadbent back to the stage. \"It was the clown in him that I first worked with and the clown in him that I wanted to work with again.

Mrs Haley is the daughter of Indian immigrants and was a vocal critic of Mr Trump on the campaign trail. A rising star in the Republican party, the 44-year-old is the youngest governor in the US. Mr Trump said in a press release: \"Governor Haley has a proven track record of bringing people together regardless of background or party affiliation to move critical policies forward for the betterment of her state and our country. \"She is also a proven dealmaker, and we look to be making plenty of deals. She will be a great leader representing us on the world stage.\" The Republican-controlled Senate will need to confirm her appointment before she officially takes office. In a statement, Mrs Haley said she was \"moved\" to accept the assignment and would remain the South Carolina governor, pending her congressional confirmation. She had endorsed Florida Senator Marco Rubio during the Republican primaries, later throwing her support behind Senator Ted Cruz - Mr Trump's final rival before he became the party's nominee. Although Mrs Haley eventually voted for Mr Trump, the governor said she was \"not a fan\" of either him or the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton. Eye-catching though her political career has been, little is known about Nikki Haley's views on the foreign affairs and the United Nations. Diplomats here have been Googling her to find out more. When her nomination was announced I was with a senior diplomat, who had expected President-elect Trump to downgrade the job of UN ambassador so that it was no longer a cabinet-level position. He was heartened that Mr Trump had selected a \"political heavyweight\", and viewed it as an early indication than the incoming administration will take the UN more seriously than he'd supposed. Certainly, she's no John Bolton, the US ambassador during the Bush administration who famously remarked that it would not make much of a difference if the UN headquarters in New York lost its top 10 floors - where the organisation's most senior figures, including the secretary general, have their offices. Many UN diplomats fear a Trump presidency and there's relief here that he hasn't appointed an outspoken UN-basher. She also sharply attacked Mr Trump's proposal to ban Muslim immigrants, calling it \"un-American\", as well as his refusal to release his tax records. For his part, Mr Trump had called her \"very weak on illegal immigration\" and said South Carolinians were \"embarrassed\" by her. But the newly minted president-elect, who will be inaugurated in January, invited her for a meeting last week at Trump Tower in Manhattan. Mrs Haley has little previous foreign policy experience, though the Charleston Post and Courier reports she has taken at least eight trips abroad since becoming governor in 2011, mostly in support of economic development deals for her state. During a trade mission to Europe in 2011, she was criticised by the newspaper for staying at expensive hotels and attending parties, costing the taxpayer $127,000 (\u00c2\u00a3103,000). Born Nimrata \"Nikki\" Randhawa, Mrs Haley was raised in a Sikh household and now identifies as a Christian. She is the first minority and female governor of South Carolina, a deeply conservative state with a long history of racial strife. She was praised by members of both parties in 2015 when she ordered the Confederate battle flag to be removed from the grounds of the state capitol after a racially motivated shooting at an African-American church in Charleston. Mrs Haley, who is in her second and final term as governor, was elected in 2010, riding a wave of the Republican Tea Party. She is married to Army National Guard Captain Michael Haley, and the couple have two teenage children.

Previous studies have linked contact with nature and improved wellbeing but this study is believed to be the first controlled experiment of its kind. The findings appear in the journal Environment and Behavior. \"There have been a few studies that have looked at things like the number of bird or butterfly species in parks and researchers have asked people in those parks about how they felt,\" explained co-author Mathew White from the University of Exeter's European Centre for Environment and Human Health (ECEHH). \"Generally, people felt happier in parks that had more birds or more butterflies, although people did not really appreciate the levels of biodiversity.\" Dr White told BBC News that there were a number of reasons why the team of researchers from the ECEHH, Plymouth University and the National Marine Aquarium were interested in the potential impact of aquariums on people's wellbeing. \"Firstly, we were particularly interested in aquatic environments,\" he said. \"Obviously most people cannot see different kinds of fish because they do not dive etc, so aquariums are a nice way to make the invisible marine environment just outside our doors visible and accessible. \"More fundamentally, we were interested in how natural environments could be brought to urban populations and to people who might not be able to access nature very well.\" Blue gyms Collecting data from participants in the aquarium provided the researchers with a unique opportunity to examine the links between human wellbeing and contact with nature. \"What we were able to do here was - as far as we know in the world's first controlled experiment: we knew exactly the number of species and the number of [fish] that people were looking at, and they were systematically altered over time - monitor people's heart rate, blood pressure and various changes in mood over a 10-minute period while they watched the very large tank (500,000 litres), \" Dr White explained. \"As you might expect, people felt a lot more relaxed and significantly happier after watching the tank with more fish - in other words with more biodiversity - and there were significant drops in heart rates and significantly lower blood pressure. \"Most of the physiological changes happened within the first five minutes and then plateaued out, so it happened quite quickly and then stabilised. However, the psychological measures showed that the benefits continued over the entire exposure - people got happier and happier, basically.\" In order to rule out the possibility that the participants were responding to the biodiversity in the tanks rather than the tranquil environment, the first set of data was gathered while the participants looked at an empty tank, which only contained rocks and lighting etc. The experiments were carried out during the day while the aquarium was open so people taking part in the experiment were experiencing the normal conditions of the aquarium, such as noise etc. Dr White added: \"The first thing to notice is that people relaxed, even watching an empty tank, and the benefits increased as we introduced more fish over the course of about a four-week period.\" The team were interested in exploring whether the experiment's results could be replicated in a medical setting. \"For example, if we were to put a live (video) link into Derriford (the local hospital) into waiting rooms or even into some of the wards and we could show clinically meaningful reductions in heart rate and blood pressure among specific groups, such as hypertension for example, it could be really important for medical reasons,\" Dr White suggested. He also said the findings also highlighted another potential ecosystem service that humans received from biodiversity. \"If you flipped our study on its head, and you were to take fish away and be losing biodiversity, what we show is that the predicted losses in biodiversity over time as a result of climate change and other anthropogenic threats could actually undermine human wellbeing in a way that we have not really thought about. \"Potentially, the effects could be quite large and could be another effect of climate change etc that we have not really understood to date.\"", "summary": "People who spend time in aquariums could improve their physical and mental wellbeing, a study has suggested."}, {"text": "The amount is broadly in line with market expectations of 60bn euros, and follows so-called stress tests of 14 Spanish lenders. Much of the money is expected to come from the eurozone rescue funds, the current EFSF and the future ESM. Spain said in July that it would request eurozone support for its banks. The Spanish banking sector has been in difficulty since the global financial crisis of 2008, and the subsequent bursting of the country's property bubble and deep recession. The European Commission welcomed the announcement, saying in a statement that it \"is a major step in implementing the financial-assistance programme and towards strengthening the viability of, and confidence in, the Spanish banking sector\". It added: \"The necessary state aid provided to Spanish banks will be determined in the coming months.\" The Commission also said that it expected the first Spanish banks to start recieving the loans \"by November.\" By Laurence KnightBusiness reporter, BBC News An independent audit of the banks confirmed on Friday that the banks are short of some 59bn euros, or almost 6% of Spanish GDP. This \"hole\" is the amount of capital that must be injected by the authorities to absorb the losses that the banks (especially regional savings banks) might suffer on all the loans they made to property developers and mortgage borrowers during the housing boom of the last decade. Some of the 59bn may also be provided by private sector investors, or by writing off the amount owed to some existing investors in the banks. The housing bubble has burst and many of those loans cannot be repaid. The eurozone has already made 100bn euros available from its rescue funds to plug this hole, although many investors suspect that the banks' needs may (eventually) exceed even this total. For Spain, the question isn't just the size of the banks' losses. It is still not clear who will ultimately bear them. Will it be the entire eurozone, through its 100bn-euro investment (as Madrid hopes), the Spanish government itself, or the (mostly Spanish) private sector investors in the banks? The Irish government was sunk by the losses incurred by its own banks after it foolishly offered to guarantee them. Spain hopes to avoid the same fate. Six burning questions for Spain Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, praised the independent valuation of Spain's banks, saying it had been \"thorough and transparent\". She added: \"Public funding of the banks' actual capital needs, which are expected to be lower than the amounts identified in the stress tests, can be financed comfortably under the recapitalisation programme supported by Spain's European partners.\" The audit calculation that Spain's banks will need 59.3bn euros is a worst-case scenario, and does not take into account any future plans by the lenders themselves to raise their own capital. The country's economy minister Fernando Jimenez Latorre indicated that it may need to borrow about 40bn from the eurozone rescue funds. Bankia was found to be the bank most in need of additional capital, requiring 24.7bn euros. It was followed by Catalunya Bank (10.8bn euros), Novagalicia (7.2bn euros), Banco de Valencia (3.5bn euros), Banco Popular (3.2bn euros), Banco Mare Nostrum (2.2bn euros), and Ibercaja-Liberbank-Caja (2.1bn euros). Seven Spanish banks have no need for extra capital - Santander, BBVA, Caixabank, Kutxabank, Sabadell, Bankinter, and Unicaja. The audit was also based on a number of assumptions, including that Spain's economy will contract by 6.5% between 2012 and 2014. The Open Europe think tank suggested many of these were overly optimistic, however. \"These tests do look to be more intense than the previous ones but ultimately the optimistic assumptions do instantly raise questions over their credibility,\" the group said. \"The prediction that unemployment will peak at 27.2% seems optimistic given that there is plenty more austerity and internal devaluation to come while the structural labour market reforms are yet to take effect.\" It added that a worsening economic situation would also increase the number of loans which are defaulted on and hit the value of the foreclosed properties which banks own. The bigger question remains whether the Spanish government will have to follow Greece, Portugal and the Republic of Ireland and request a full international bailout, involving loans that have to be paid off by the state, as well as close monitoring of its economy by its international creditors. While Madrid continues to publicly deny this, the markets consider it only a matter of time. On Thursday, the Spanish government announced its latest austerity budget. Against a backdrop of violent protests, it outlined new spending cuts, but protected pensions. Spain is struggling with a shrinking economy and 25% unemployment. Comments from its central bank earlier this week indicated that the country's recession deepened in the past three months.

Mr Boyd conceded that national insurance and pension contributions had risen, but said these were \"part of a wider government strategy to ensure public sector pensions remain affordable and sustainable\". \"Public sector pensions remain attractive and in general offer much better terms than those available in the private sector.\" However, the NASUWT's general secretary Chris Keates said his letter would infuriate teachers. \"Teachers will not be persuaded or intimidated by the fake news presented in the letter,\" she said. \"The value of teachers' pay has fallen by around 20% since 2010. \"The employers should start to devote more of their time to addressing the genuine concerns of teachers rather than peddling misinformation.\" The letter will not help to resolve disputes between teachers and their employers, said Heather Watson, the principal of Phoenix Integrated Primary School in Cookstown, County Tyrone. She was \"shocked, confused and disappointed\" when she received the letter. \"It hasn't done anything to reassure teachers that they are respected and valued,\" said Ms Watson. \"I understand that there are two sides to this, but I really want the two sides to get their act together and address the issues.\" Jim Clarke, the chief executive of the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, which represents teachers' employers, said the information in the letter was \"factually accurate\". \"It might not necessarily agree with everyone's perspective but all we can do is present the facts as they are,\" he added.

Its report called for whistleblowers to be offered legal and counselling help and for \"swift sanctions\" to be imposed on staff who victimised them. The government said it was acting to ensure people felt free to speak out. The report highlighted the \"important\" role whistleblowers had played in uncovering details about the Hillsborough disaster and the Mid Staffordshire NHS trust scandal. The committee said whistleblowing was a \"crucial source of intelligence to help government identify wrongdoing\". However, it found there had been a \"startling disconnect\" between policies encouraging whistleblowers in theory and what happened in practice. The report said it had \"heard of too many cases of appalling treatment of whistleblowers by their colleagues\". Officials who tried to raise concerns often had to show \"remarkable courage\" in coming forward. The report highlighted whistleblowing in relation to the Hillsborough disaster on 15 April 1989, where 96 Liverpool fans at an FA Cup semi-final lost their lives. Prime Minister David Cameron later apologised for the \"double injustice\" of the disaster, after an independent report published in 2012 showed police and emergency services had attempted to deflect the blame. It also highlighted the Mid Staffordshire NHS scandal, where staff at Stafford Hospital had blown the whistle on \"appalling care\" between 2005 and 2008. The committee heard from Kay Sheldon, a member of the board of the Care Quality Commission who, the report said, had been \"victimised\" by senior officials after she tried to raise concerns about the way it had been operating. The report said no-one had faced any form of sanction over her treatment. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the public accounts committee, said whistleblowing was \"crucial\" and must be taken seriously by all chief executives of major companies and public sector organisations. She said protection for whistleblowers was still not adequate, citing the example of Osita Mba - a former lawyer at Revenue and Customs who drew attention to what he claimed were \"sweetheart deals\" between the tax authorities and Goldman Sachs. She said Mr Mba was a \"really brave guy\" but it had become \"impossible for him\" to remain with the organisation after his disclosures and he had had \"to start his life again elsewhere\". \"The way you support whistleblowers is hugely important,\" she added. \"I think it is really important that there are proper sanctions in place in an organisation so if someone does blow the whistle, they are properly supported and if anyone dares bully or harass them, they are not only reprimanded but punished.\" Legal protections for whistleblowers The 1998 Public Disclosure Act protects workers who disclose information about potential criminal behaviour and other malpractice at their workplace, or former workplace, provided certain conditions are met. Depending on the nature of information disclosed and who it is confided to, a whistleblower is legally protected from suffering from any detriment as a result. If these conditions are not met, a disclosure may constitute a breach of the worker's duty of confidence to his employer. The laws apply to direct employees and agency workers but not those working for the security services, and campaign group Public Concern at Work says other individuals - such as volunteers and interns - are also excluded. The law was amended last year to include a specific public interest test, whereby whistleblowers have to \"reasonably believe\" that their actions are in the public interest to be protected. Workers who raise concerns about bullying and harassment by work colleagues are also protected. Colleagues who victimise them are personally liable for their actions while their employers are \"vicariously liable\". The Taxpayers' Alliance said the report suggested there was a \"culture of secrecy\" in much of the public sector and whistleblowing must be encouraged. \"Though the practice often asks tough questions, it is a crucial tool to increase the accountability of those in charge and to ensure our public services work as well as possible for the people who need them,\" the campaign group's chief executive Jonathan Isaby said. A government spokeswoman said: \"All civil servants must be able to raise concerns so that poor services and inefficient operations can be identified and acted upon. \"That is why this government is ensuring people feel free to speak out. Awareness of how to raise a complaint has risen by 20% and two-thirds of civil servants feel that any complaint will be investigated properly. \"In addition, we are ensuring that all departments have a clear whistleblowing policy.\" Labour said whistleblowing had led, in many cases, to major changes in policy. \"There must be a clear standardised policy for handling whistleblowers working across all of our public services to ensure that there are no disparities in how people are dealt with, and that staff are protected from being victimised.\" said shadow Cabinet Office minister Michael Dugher.", "summary": "The treatment of employees in public services who have raised concerns about wrongdoing has often been \"shocking\", a group of MPs has said."}, {"text": "Restoring the function of the organ - which helps control blood sugar levels - reversed symptoms of diabetes in animal experiments. The study, published in the journal Cell, says the diet reboots the body. Experts said the findings were \"potentially very exciting\" as they could become a new treatment for the disease. The experiments were on mice put on a modified form of the \"fasting-mimicking diet\". When people go on it they spend five days on a low calorie, low protein, low carbohydrate but high unsaturated-fat diet. It resembles a vegan diet with nuts and soups, but with around 800 to 1,100 calories a day. Then they have 25 days eating what they want - so overall it mimics periods of feast and famine. Previous research has suggested it can slow the pace of ageing. But animal experiments showed the diet regenerated a special type of cell in the pancreas called a beta cell. These are the cells that detect sugar in the blood and release the hormone insulin if it gets too high. Dr Valter Longo, from the University of Southern California, said: \"Our conclusion is that by pushing the mice into an extreme state and then bringing them back - by starving them and then feeding them again - the cells in the pancreas are triggered to use some kind of developmental reprogramming that rebuilds the part of the organ that's no longer functioning.\" There were benefits in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the mouse experiments. Type 1 is caused by the immune system destroying beta cells and type 2 is largely caused by lifestyle and the body no longer responding to insulin. Further tests on tissue samples from people with type 1 diabetes produced similar effects. Dr Longo said: \"Medically, these findings have the potential to be very important because we've shown - at least in mouse models - that you can use diet to reverse the symptoms of diabetes. \"Scientifically, the findings are perhaps even more important because we've shown that you can use diet to reprogram cells without having to make any genetic alterations.\" BBC reporter Peter Bowes took part in a separate trial with Dr Valter Longo. He said: \"During each five-day fasting cycle, when I ate about a quarter of the average person's diet, I lost between 2kg and 4kg (4.4-8.8lbs). \"But before the next cycle came round, 25 days of eating normally had returned me almost to my original weight. \"But not all consequences of the diet faded so quickly.\" His blood pressure was lower as was a hormone called IGF-1, which is linked to some cancers. He said: \"The very small meals I was given during the five-day fast were far from gourmet cooking, but I was glad to have something to eat\" Peter Bowes: Fasting for science Peter Bowes: Intermittent fasting and the good things it did to my body Separate trials of the diet in people have been shown to improve blood sugar levels. The latest findings help to explain why. However, Dr Longo said people should not rush off and crash diet. He told the BBC: \"It boils down to do not try this at home, this is so much more sophisticated than people realise.\" He said people could \"get into trouble\" with their health if it was done without medical guidance. Dr Emily Burns, research communications manager at Diabetes UK, said: \"This is potentially very exciting news, but we need to see if the results hold true in humans before we'll know more about what it means for people with diabetes. \"People with type-1 and type-2 diabetes would benefit immensely from treatments that can repair or regenerate insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\" Follow James on Twitter.", "summary": "The pancreas can be triggered to regenerate itself through a type of fasting diet, say US researchers."}, {"text": "Harper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote. Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - \"Hell, no\" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. \"She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'\" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. \"And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' \"And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'\" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the \"conflict of the human soul\" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a \"fuzzy-cheeked young preacher\" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. \"The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,\" the Rev Butts told me. \"The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. \"Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice.\" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird. The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions. \"Being famous I'm sure is a lot of fun for a year or two.

To no-one's surprise, given the way the pair parted company after Mr Sarkozy lost the presidency in 2012, it drips with the satisfaction of a finally requited revenge. I have known some acts of treachery in my time... but rarely like this\" In one passage, Mr Buisson claims that Nicolas Sarkozy deliberately allowed rioters from the suburbs to rampage in central Paris, the better to show off his capacity to restore order. It was in 2006, when Mr Sarkozy was at the interior ministry and his rival, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, was pushing through a labour reform hotly contested by French youth. Mr Buisson quotes Mr Sarkozy as recalling: \"We took the decision to allow gangs of blacks and Arabs to attack the young whites on the Invalides, and at the same time tipped off the photographers at Paris Match that there was likely to be serious trouble. \"We were petrified that someone might end up getting seriously hurt, but in the end it was worth it.\" At the demonstration that followed, police intervened early and Mr Sarkozy was on hand for the television cameras, \"proving how much he was in control of the situation compared with the prime minister\", writes Mr Buisson. The former adviser is scathing about Mr Sarkozy's \"narcissistic\" personality, and says his public courtship and marriage to \"trophy woman\" Carla Bruni was an excruciating embarrassment. \"Probably he thought deep down that the happy news of his love life would be a useful antidote to the prevailing gloom. Instead [the reaction] could be summed up in three words: immature, undignified, infantile.\" He is also unsparing of Carla Bruni herself, who he says \"did deep harm to [the Sarkozy] presidency\". \"The head of state... was in reality a fragile seducer subjugated by his conquests, a fake tough guy submerged in a permanent state of emotional dependency.\" In politics, Mr Buisson says Nicolas Sarkozy was always words rather than action, that he lacked guiding principles and was more interested in the short-term buzz of media approval. \"The public man... was always constrained by the private man, by his passions, his confusions, his weakness for whatever was in vogue.\" The book reveals that the aspiring president was in contact with far-right National Front (FN) leader Jean-Marie Le Pen between the two rounds of the 2007 election, which he won, in the hope of winning FN votes for round two. And in 2005 Mr Buisson quotes him as saying: \"The values of the far right are the values of all the French. It's just the way the FN puts them that is shocking. The French do not like over-spicy food.\" Now fully engaged in November's primary to choose the centre-right's presidential candidate, Nicolas Sarkozy has dismissed Mr Buisson's book as unworthy of notice. The two men fell out after the former president's 2012 election defeat by Francois Hollande. Two years later it was revealed that throughout the Sarkozy presidency Mr Buisson had been secretly recording conversations and meetings at the Elysee. Speaking on television at the time, Mr Sarkozy said: \"I have known some acts of treachery in my time, but rarely like this!\" Mr Buisson was convicted of invasion of privacy and ordered to pay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20,000 (\u00c2\u00a317,000; $22,000) in damages to Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni.

Carried out by security experts and Google, the project analysed more than 100 million visits to the search giant's sites. It led to Google purging almost 200 bad extensions from its online catalogues of browser add-ons. Extensions and add-ons for web browsers add all kinds of functions and features to the software. Many of these extensions have hidden extras that cause trouble for people who install them, said UC Santa Barbara computer scientist Alexandros Kapravelos, who worked with Google on the rogue extensions project. The research found that malicious extensions were available for every major browser. The findings are due to be published in full in May at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy. Preliminary results revealed that 5% of people accessing Google every day have been caught out by at least one malicious extension. Of these victims, about a third have four or more bad add-ons installed in their browser. \"It is a very hard problem to deal with,\" said Mr Kapravelos. Some bad extensions were easy to spot, he said, because they were so obviously written to steal saleable data such as bitcoins, bank logins or personal data. However, many used techniques seen in legitimate extensions, he said, and it took a lot of extra analysis to pin down the bad ones. \"Even when we have a complete understanding of what the extension is doing, sometimes it is not clear if that behaviour is malicious or not,\" he said. \"You would expect that an extension that injects or replaces advertisements is malicious, but then you have AdBlock that creates an ad-free browsing experience and is technically very similar.\" Experts from Swedish security firm ScrapeSentry said it had found examples of extensions that gathered data in ways that could easily be abused. ScrapeSentry's analysis of one extension, called Webpage Screenshot, revealed that it contained code that let it grab copies of all the browser traffic from the PC on which it was installed. The gathered data was then sent to a server in the US. The extension has been downloaded about 1.2 million times. \"What happens to the personal data and the motives for sending it to the US server is anyone's guess, but we'd take an educated guess that it's not going to be good news,\" said Martin Zetterlund from ScrapeSentry. A spokesman for Webpage Screenshot said there was nothing malicious about the data it gathered. Instead, said the spokesman, it was used to understand who the extension's users were and where they were located to help drive development of the code. Users could opt out of sharing data, he said. Mr Kapravelos said Google had acted on the early findings of the research by removing 192 actively malicious extensions from its Chrome catalogue. About 14 million people had been tricked into using these extensions, he said. The UC Santa Barbara team was working with Google to develop tools that can automatically spot malicious extensions and flag them to the search giant's security staff. In addition, said Mr Kapravelos, firms whose adverts were being injected onto webpages by the rogue extensions had been informed. Unfortunately, he said, ad injection had become \"entrenched\" as a way for some unscrupulous developers to make money. The research found that only a small number of developers were behind the majority of the rogue extensions that pepper people with ads, suggesting that targeted action could help tackle the problem.", "summary": "Tens of millions of users who visit Google sites use a browser loaded with malicious add-ons, research suggests."}, {"text": "Media playback is not supported on this device Cook's side carry a 1-0 lead into the second Test at Lord's on Thursday, after last week's 169-run victory. But Cook said: \"Australia are still probably favourites, they've only got to retain, I suppose. \"But series are not played on paper, it's what people deliver. And it's always nice to be underdogs isn't it?\" England, who are taking precautions over the fitness of all-rounder Moeen Ali before the second Test, were hammered 5-0 by Australia in the last Ashes down under in 2013-14. But, following the departure of coach Peter Moores in May, they have undergone an overhaul both on and off the pitch. Under the interim leadership of assistant coach Paul Farbrace, they played positively in the drawn Test series and victorious one-day series against New Zealand. Victory in new head coach Trevor Bayliss's first match in charge gave them the early advantage in the Ashes series. Cook is keen for his side to continue in that positive vein against an Australia side that is likely to feature a number of changes, with wicketkeeper Brad Haddin absent for personal reasons while reports suggest all-rounder Shane Watson will be dropped. \"I think it is important that we don't sit back and protect the lead,\" Cook told BBC Sport. \"We can't do that, certainly not against Australia. \"We have made a big effort with this series not to worry about what Australia do. It is about our attitude and approach. If we can get near the standards of Cardiff we will be a tough team to beat.\" England have won the past two matches between the two at Lord's, following Australia's 75-year unbeaten run at the home of cricket. England's only injury concern is over Moeen, who has felt some soreness in his side following the first Test. Moeen played a key role in the victory in Wales, scoring a brisk 77 at number eight in the first innings and taking five wickets in the match. Cook told BBC Sport: \"He has come through training and fingers crossed he will be fine, which is great news for us. \"He is fine but you always want to be careful and head into an Ashes Test match with people fully fit.\" Uncapped Yorkshire leg-spinner Adil Rashid is on standby should Moeen fail to prove his fitness. In the absence of Haddin, the uncapped Peter Nevill takes over as wicketkeeper. \"I am confident with Nev coming in that we have the wicketkeeper spot covered,\" captain Michael Clarke told BBC Sport. \"He is a fighter and has had a great year back in Australia. \"He deserves his opportunity. He won his spot on form and that is why he is in the squad. I have every confidence he will walk out there and make runs.\" Clarke also expects seam bowler Mitchell Starc to be fit to play, despite suffering an ankle strain that required pain-killing injections in the first Test. Clarke said: \"He took eight wickets. He bowled on one leg in the second innings and still took three wickets. He is a wicket-taker. But all our bowlers need to be more consistent.\" Watson, who was lbw in both innings of the first Test for scores of 30 and 19, is reportedly set to be dropped, with Mitchell Marsh taking his place. However, Clarke said he does not yet know the XI, adding: \"Whoever is picked needs to perform, like the rest of us.\" The 34-year-old added: \"We were outplayed in all facets in the first Test. We have taken the positives and we come here to Lord's and start afresh. \"We have played some really good cricket over the last couple of years and the boys are full of confidence. \"We know how we can play if we are at our best and the boys just need to find that consistently over the five days. We need to bat for long periods, have really good intent with the ball and execution over long periods.\" The pitch at Cardiff was slow, which many felt helped England as it negated the Australian pace attack. Both captains expect a similar surface at Lord's, with Cook saying: \"Normally a Test wicket here is a pretty good wicket. We are in England and I don't think it will be travelling through like Perth.\" Clarke said: \"I think it will be a little bit tacky to start and seam around early so it will be difficult to bat on. But it does look like a pretty good wicket. Generally at Lord's, once the sun comes out, it is a good wicket to bat on.\" Players will also have to contest with the Lord's slope, with batsmen requiring judgement on which balls to play and leave and bowlers requiring greater discipline with their line. Only Mitchell Johnson of the Australia bowling attack has played at Lord's before and his record is poor, conceding 200 runs in 38.4 overs (taking three wickets) in the second Test in 2009. England's James Anderson is the record wicket-taker on the ground with 75 in 17 matches, with Stuart Broad the fourth highest (61 wickets in 14 Tests). Unlike Cardiff, where rain threatened to affect the final day - should the game have gone that far, the forecast for Lord's is good, with BBC Weather stating Thursday will be \"a dry and fine day... with bright or sunny spells developing as cloud breaks and winds staying light\". It is a similar picture across the five days. One of the net bowlers for England in the build-up to this Test is the son of India great Sachin Tendulkar, the leading Test run-scorer in history.

Education minister Esteban Bullrich's plan would add a 25% higher penalty if an offence was against a teacher. Mr Bullrich said it would make sure the public showed them more \"respect\". If the law is adopted by Argentina's congress it would mean any attack against a teacher would become an aggravated offence with increased penalties. It would apply to parents and students and would include verbal abuse or threats as well as physical violence. An offender attacking a teacher would receive a 25% longer prison sentence or pay a 25% bigger fine than if a similar offence had been committed against anyone else. The plan, developed by the education minister and Argentina's president, Mauricio Macri, is a way of supporting their government's \"education revolution\". \"We knew we needed to raise the image of teachers in our society. Slowly, but steadily, their image had fallen,\" Mr Bullrich told the BBC. \"There were increased cases of disrespect from parents and students and even aggression towards teachers. \"That's when the idea of distinguishing teachers in our penal code came up. If you hit or shout at a teacher, then you are doing so towards the most important member in our society. \"Without teachers we would not have ministers or presidents, we would not have the world today. Let us grant them that respect and distinguished treatment.\" More stories from the BBC's Global education series looking at education from an international perspective and how to get in touch John Bangs of Education International, an international federation of teachers' unions, supported the signal sent by the idea of tougher penalties for assaults on teachers. \"'Schools are fundamental to their communities.

Nothing could be more corrosive to confidence and learning. \"Argentina's action might appear to be a simplistic response to complex problem, but it gives a powerful message that violence against a teacher is not only an individual assault but an assault on education.\" Argentina's education system, which has performed poorly in international tests, has faced waves of industrial unrest, and Mr Bullrich has campaigned to gain the support of teachers for education reform. As minister for education in Argentina's capital, Buenos Aires, he published his personal mobile phone number so that teachers could ring him directly with their problems. The minister said teachers thought no-one in government was listening to them and that was contributing to low morale and disaffection. Mr Bullrich gave out his mobile number for \"questions, comments and complaints\", in a bid to tackle teachers' practical worries such as errors with pay and allowances or problems with school buildings. \"People didn't really know if it was true that I would answer,\" said Mr Bullrich when he launched the scheme. \"This guy rang at 02:00 and really blasted me on the phone - 'You owe me money.' So I called him back at 02.15 and said, 'Hello this is the minister of education.' First there was silence on the line and then we got the information and we solved the problem.\" The number of teachers' strikes fell sharply in Buenos Aires. Now Mr Bullrich is the national education minister and he has continued offering his mobile phone number - and he says that he receives hundreds of phone calls each day. In England, teachers' unions have made repeated warnings about attacks on school staff. The ATL teachers' union recently published a survey claiming four out of 10 teachers had experienced violence in the past year. This included being hit, kicked or having objects thrown at them. There have been international efforts to formally give schools and teachers a protected status during wars and conflicts. It followed concerns that places of education were being attacked, whether accidentally or deliberately, and they did not have the same protection that was accorded to hospitals or medical staff in warzones.

Despite questioning by AMs, Emyr Roberts did not give a clear answer as to whether that has happened. He said the deal - an effort to deal with diseased larch - was a success. Although he was happy with the decision, Mr Roberts admitted that its documentation was \"not good\", that there should have been more discussion with Welsh Government and that the executive board could have had a greater role in scrutinising the deal. A member of the committee, Lee Waters, later dubbed the answers \"unconvincing\". In 2014 a company was awarded a \u00a339m deal to purchased both spruce and larch timber - the latter of which was forests where a fungus disease causing extensive damage - Phytophthora ramorum - was present. No other company was given the opportunity to bid for the contracts. As part of that deal the company was meant to have built a new saw line by 31 March 2016. That deadline was missed and extended by 12 months to March 2017. During a session of the assembly's Public Accounts Committee, Labour Llanelli AM Lee Waters asked Mr Roberts if the line had been built. \"We are in on going discussions with the operator on that,\" said Mr Roberts. Mr Waters pressed him again, pointing out that the date of the committee's meeting was 28 March. Mr Roberts repeated the answer, adding later it was a \"commercial matter\". Mr Waters asked if Mr Roberts felt the firm \"pulled the wool over your eyes in making you feel that the only way they were going to deal with this crisis was by investing in new expensive capital equipment\". Mr Roberts replied with a denial: \"No, I don't think they have pulled the wool over our eyes at all.\" \"At the time, there was no market for larch,\" he said, claiming timber merchants at the time \"would not touch larch, let alone diseased larch\". \"What the operator did and the rest of the industry did was actually build up that market.\" Mr Roberts said there was a \"real crisis on our hands at the time\" and there had been a danger the timber market would collapse. \"The situation today was a lot more stable than it was in 2013-14. Our policy, our decisions on these contracts together with the overarching policy in treating larch disease has been successful,\" he said. \"It's stopped the spread, but it's meant the timber market has been able to carry on as well.\" A report by auditor general Huw Vaughan Thomas released earlier in March expressed doubt over whether the decision met state aid rules and said the decision-making process was not transparent. In a qualification to the body's accounts he said he was unable to satisfy himself on whether the decision to make the deal was lawful. NRW disputed the auditor's findings on state aid and had said it strongly believed the contracts were lawful. Neither NRW or the auditors have identified the company involved. Following the meeting Mr Waters said the answers given by the chief executive \"were not satisfactory\" and that the evidence was \"unconvincing\". He said it was a \"serious issue which has been badly handled\". Mr Waters said it was clear from the evidence \"with two days to go before the end of March the saw mill line has not been installed by this company\". \"I think the whole committee felt that the performance was complacent and this was a sufficiently grave situation for the auditor general to qualify the accounts, which rarely happens,\" he told BBC Wales. \"I think the committee will be referring this to the full assembly to draw this to their attention,\" he said.", "summary": "The chief executive of Natural Resources Wales has denied the organisation had the \"wool pulled over our eyes\" by a sawmill operator given a 10 year timber contract that was criticised by an audit."}, {"text": "This is not because of panic, but possibly as a way of suppressing it. As one MP put it: \"The wise heads will need to tell any hotheads to calm down.\" The prime minister will meet her internal critics head on. Having phoned over the weekend candidates who were defeated in an election she didn't need to call, she will find that many of those who escaped that fate are cross. But widespread demands for her to go are not expected. Instead, there will be demands for her to consult more, including meeting regularly with the 1922 executive, and to turn Downing Street from a bunker into an open house by broadening her range of staff. However, few MPs expect her position to be strong and stable for the next five years. One senior backbencher told me: \"It is inconceivable she will lead the party into the next election. Her authority has been diminished unquestionably.\" Another said: \"Party members have been too bruised by her.\" \"She has bought herself some time\", said a senior backbencher, but added: \"How she behaves will determine how long she's there.\" There is a feeling that the party is holding on to nurse for fear of something worse. \"There is zero appetite for another election,\" as one MP put it, and a feeling that, in an early poll, victory wouldn't be guaranteed. Some say Labour's digital campaign and mobilisation of young people was particularly impressive, and another election would give Jeremy Corbyn the opportunity to do what he does best - campaign. Equally, a leadership election could be destabilising ahead of Brexit talks - though it's widely expected one will take place well before 2022. Some kind of arrangement with the DUP is seen as inevitable, but one MP cautioned \"the devil is in the detail\". One of the reasons the 1922 meeting has been moved forward is so any deal can be discussed before it is sealed. Nonetheless, it is anticipated that the most flexible of arrangements is likely to be put in place; one that would mean there would have to be negotiations with the DUP on an issue-by-issue basis. Theresa May is expected to hear strong criticisms of what one backbencher dubbed \"her miserable manifesto\". Of course, some individual policies, such as social care - \"It went down like a lead balloon\" - will be singled out, but the presentation of policy will also be attacked. MPs will say that an effective fourfold lifting of the floor on residential care costs wasn't widely understood. And a campaign which barely mentioned the economy will come under fire. \"We didn't dodge a bullet but were winged,\" said one. \"If Labour had a more credible leader we could have been in even bigger difficulties.\" There has been speculation that there may now be a \"softer Brexit\", partly because of an influx of Scottish MPs who favour close trading relationships with the EU, but also because of the elevation of Damian Green to First Secretary of State. He is a friend of Mrs May's, a Remainer in the referendum campaign, and he has warned that concessions may have to be made in negotiations. But some senior Tories have told me that they will urge her to stick to her manifesto commitments on Brexit and, for them, controls on immigration and coming out of the single market are \"bottom lines\". Others will want to insist on the freedom to strike trade deals, so coming out of the customs union is seen as essential. \"We must hold our nerve on Brexit,\" said one. However, another senior backbencher recognised that it would now be inevitable that Parliament would have greater influence over the process. \"She will be walking a tightrope\", and, while MPs seem to see the necessity, in the words of one former minister, to \"shore her up in the short term\", if she stumbles, she can fall at any time.", "summary": "A meeting of the Conservative Party's influential backbench 1922 committee - in effect all Conservative backbenchers - has been brought forward by 24 hours to 17:00 BST on Monday."}, {"text": "Two years down the line, Jones has now become a mother - and says this has given her a new awareness of what mum-of-one Gemma Foster went through. \"Being a wife and a mother made me realise the gravitas of that unit falling apart, because I'd go home at night and I'd have a baby to put to bed,\" she says. \"So I think it definitely made me realise when two people get together and have a child out of love and then they split... what it is to parent a child and be in each other's lives when you are damaged and hurt without damaging and hurting a child.\" Jones brought her son to set - he doesn't appear in the show, but \"looked much better than I did\" on camera, she jokes.

Jones admits it can be \"uncomfortable\" viewing at times but says the show has a \"weird, sexy edge to it\". \"We all know what it feels like to be in a room with an ex-partner,\" she goes on. \"Everybody has had a relationship, everyone has had exes, everybody has been in difficult circumstances. I'm sure myself and Bertie have had those thoughts and feelings; otherwise we wouldn't be able to draw on them. \"But at the same time, with the style of writing and the style of the programme, you're able to go further. \"It has a fantastical edge as well as being deep-rooted in naturalism. It also has an exaggerated way of showing how far you could go if you really wanted to.\" Carvel, who played Miss Trunchbull in West End musical Matilda, says he found Mike Bartlett's writing \"exciting\" and that the Doctor Foster plot was a \"real page-turner\". \"He gives us incredibly three-dimensional characters\", says the actor, adding that it was \"really fun\" to play a character who makes the audience change their opinion about him as the drama progresses. \"Often you find yourself looking at something from a really different point of view,\" he says. \"That's what's exciting about this series as a whole.\" Jones says the original plan was to give Gemma a new look.

The first series' final scene saw Gemma and her son together, seeing her former husband with his pregnant new partner. \"It looks like a happy ending, but there are lots of threads untied\", Bartlett goes on. \"There's more to tell, so when we had the opportunity, I thought we should.\" Doctor Foster returns to BBC One next month.

On 26 September, just four days after Telegram trumpeted the launch of its new \"Channels\" tool, IS media operatives on Twitter started advertising the group's own channel dubbed Nashir, which translates as \"Distributor\" in English. It has already amassed more than 4,500 subscribers. Since then, IS propaganda has started appearing first via Telegram, often several minutes before being posted to Twitter. The group's claim for an attack on Saudi and Emirati forces at a hotel in the Yemeni city of Aden on Tuesday was posted first on Telegram, for example, although Twitter remains a key platform for IS to spread its message. IS appears to be hoping the Berlin-based Telegram will offer it a more stable and resilient platform for its propaganda, faced with a sustained clampdown on its Twitter presence. But Telegram itself suggests it will take down illegal material that is made publicly available via the app - including posts related to IS, according to its website. IS has not had an official presence on Twitter since July 2014, when its last branded accounts were shut down. It then experimented with a series of less well-known social media platforms, such as the privacy-focused Diaspora as well as VKontakte, Russia's largest social network, whose co-founders the Durov brothers went on to set up Telegram in 2013. But IS was soon kicked off those platforms too. Since then, Twitter has remained the group's preferred platform. But it has been caught up in a cat-and-mouse game with the Twitter administration, which has also led to its quasi-official, non-branded accounts routinely suspended. Even before IS launched its latest propaganda channel via Telegram, there had been evidence that the group and its members were using the app. Earlier in September, IS had advertised an Iraqi mobile phone number, which people could use to get in touch with the group via the Telegram app in order to pay a ransom for two hostages being held by the group. And jihadists inspired by IS, including a British teenager convicted recently, have used the app's secure encrypted messaging to conduct attack planning. Jihadists have been drawn by Telegram's boast to provide a \"secret chat\" facility, which heavily encrypts messages user-to-user with a unique key to avoid interception by hackers or government agencies. Telegram is so confident of its security that it twice offered a $300,000 reward to the first person who could crack its encryption. But it is the app's new public broadcast function that jihadists have been quick to latch on to and it is not just IS that has started exploiting it. Al-Qaeda's Yemen branch (AQAP) launched its own Telegram \"channel\" on 25 September, although its material is still coming out first via Twitter, where the group has its own official accounts. And the Libyan Ansar al-Shari'ah group created its channel the following day. A raft of other pro-IS and pro-al-Qaeda media groups have also set up shop there.

Bieber later told fans he was \"getting better\" and that \"milk was a bad choice\". The following year he had to take a 20-minute break mid-set due to breathing problems - but once again, he insisted on getting to the end of the performance. What a pro. Perhaps Biebs could have shared stories with Rihanna about his experiences - as the same thing had happened to her while she was playing in Portugal. She was at Lisbon's Atlantico Arena when she had to run off during What's My Name to be sick. RiRi tweeted a fan at the time, saying she \"made it juuuust in time for RudeBoy\", with her dancers covering for her while she was ill. Last year, she had to cancel her Grammys performance though under doctor's orders - she was suffering from bronchitis that time. Haim bassist Este has type one diabetes - which means her body can't control blood sugar levels and that she needs to inject insulin. But when she was playing on the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury 2013, she realised her sugar levels were plummeting due to the fact she'd not eaten enough. She came off stage and her manager checked her levels and rubbed chocolate inside her mouth to give her much-needed glucose. After two minutes, she got back on to perform the rest of the set with her sisters. Este admitted she had to do it \"sitting down like BB King\" however - and that now she makes sure she's had her \"fuel for the day\". When Dave Grohl fell off stage at a concert in Sweden two years ago, he broke his leg - an injury that led to the Foo Fighters cancelling their headline slot at Glastonbury that summer. But get this. Even though he was in pain, and would eventually need six metal screws put in his leg, he finished the show at the Ullevi Stadium before being taken to hospital. And then, a month after the accident, he took to the stage again. Grohl sat on a throne decorated with guitars for a show in Washington DC to mark the 20th anniversary of the band's first album. He's seen on it above at a gig in Seoul later that month. Bit of a vintage one now.

Mr Kadyrov has now re-asserted his claims and gone even further in an online editorial for pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia. Referring to a \"half-witted rabble\", he offered opposition activists the services of a Chechen psychiatric hospital to treat their \"mass psychosis\". \"I promise we won't spare the injections. We can do double,\" he wrote. A boxer-turned-insurgent and now a self-styled \"foot soldier\" of President Putin, the man known simply as Ramzan is not someone many in Russia dare criticise openly. Human rights groups have long accused him of presiding over widespread abuses in the Russian republic, and the key suspect in last year's shock shooting of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov beside the Kremlin walls had been deputy commander of one of his elite battalions. He was referred to by Ramzan as a \"true patriot\". This time, the Chechen leader's comments appear to have touched a nerve. The most dramatic response came from a little-known independent politician in Siberia, who raged against Ramzan on his Facebook page as the \"shame of Russia\". \"Why don't you get lost?\" Konstantin Senchenko told him, and let \"normal, honest people\" work for the good of the country. But the Siberian was soon eating his \"hasty\" words. The next day, he apologised profusely on Facebook for his \"discourtesy\", apparently after multiple calls from Chechnya. Cartoons of his sudden change of heart soon spread on social media, depicting him begging forgiveness with a gun to his head. In an ultimate humiliation, the shamefaced politician was seen in a video clip apologising personally to Ramzan for his \"emotional outburst\". Activists on Twitter then took up the Siberian's insult with the hashtag #KadyrovshameofRussia. Well-known opposition journalists followed that by filming themselves making fake, grovelling apologies to Ramzan \"for existing\". One was filmed running on a treadmill with no trousers, just as a young Chechen man was forced to do recently after criticising Ramzan Kadyrov on Instagram. Meanwhile, a group of prominent Russian liberals has begun gathering signatures demanding his resignation, and a St Petersburg politician has called on prosecutors to examine his statements for extremism. But the backlash has only increased the tirade from Chechnya, where local politicians have been falling over themselves to express devotion to their leader. None has outdone the speaker of parliament, Magomed Daudov, who posted a photograph of his boss holding back his huge, fierce dog on a leash and warned that Tarzan's teeth were \"itching\" - naming four well-known opposition figures whom the hound would presumably love to sink them into. \"Tarzan has become very frisky. We can barely restrain him,\" wrote the speaker in an Instagram post that attracted over 6,000 likes. \"Just imagine what would happen\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 If it weren't for\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Democracy.\" There is some talk that this is all a show of strength by the Chechen leader: a reminder of the considerable forces at his disposal amid talk of a power struggle between Grozny and Moscow. But the Kremlin has remained tight-lipped throughout, prompting others to conclude that it more likely endorses Ramzan's actions. Parliamentary elections are due later this year and, with an economy battered by falling oil prices, there's concern that opposition groups could capitalise on potential social unrest. \"It's a message to all of those who don't agree with what's happening,\" argues former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is now an opposition activist in exile and himself one of the obvious targets of Ramzan Kadyrov's ire. \"The authorities are afraid and they decided to frighten society,\" wrote Mr Khodorkovsky on his blog. Another commentator has suggested that the Chechen leader simply wants to underline his loyalty to Moscow ahead of a wave of forced budget cuts and to ensure that the generous flow of federal subsidies to Chechnya does not stop. Whatever the motive, the practice of singling out traitors is seen as particularly dangerous in the wake of Boris Nemtsov's murder. A year ago, Putin loyalists were still beating the drum of patriotism following the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine; state TV was lashing out viciously at Kremlin critics; warnings that Ukraine-style revolutions would not be tolerated were rife. Ramzan Kadyrov's latest outburst has resurrected the idea of an enemy within and the search for a scapegoat. \"The situation is very tense now,\" Mr Senchenko, explained by phone from Krasnoyarsk, pointing to Russia's mounting economic problems. That concern is what motivated his own Facebook rage against Chechnya's leader. \"Some people really think there are enemies of the state and it's not clear what can enter their heads,\" he warned. \"So we need to be careful.\"", "summary": "Traitors, jackals and vile liberals are just a few of the choice descriptions of Russia's opposition emerging from Chechnya in recent days, in a war of words that threatens to escalate."}, {"text": "Petro Poroshenko said 80% of Ukraine's troops left on Wednesday morning after several days of fierce fighting. Russia said Ukrainian forces had tried to fight their way out of the town after being encircled but Mr Poroshenko insisted they were never surrounded. The rebel advance on Debaltseve, which came in spite of the recent ceasefire agreement, has been widely condemned. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said the rebels' offensive had put the wider peace agreement at risk and urged Russia to \"use all its influence on the separatists to make them respect the ceasefire\". He also called on Moscow to withdraw its forces from Ukraine, saying Russian troops, artillery and air defence units were still active in the country. Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov insisted the rebels' actions in Debaltseve had not violated the ceasefire because it was a rebel-held city when the peace agreement was signed last week. He urged rebels to provide troops who surrendered with food and clothes and said he hoped the situation in the city would \"not be used to find a pretext to actually undermine [the agreement]\". Eyewitnesses saw dozens of tanks and columns of weary Ukrainian troops retreating from Debaltseve on Wednesday. Russia's state-controlled Channel One TV showed footage of what it said were rebels raising their flag on top of a high-rise building in the town. Later rebel spokesman Eduard Basurin was quoted in Russian media as saying Debaltseve was fully under the control of separatists, although there were still \"disparate groups of the enemy\" in the southern part of town. One rebel commander in the city told the BBC that conditions were dire, with no electricity and a shortage of food and water. He said rebels were sharing their rations with the remaining civilians. President Poroshenko said in a statement: \"Debaltseve was under our control, there was no encirclement, and our troops left the area in a planned and organised manner.\" He called for \"a firm reaction from the world to Russia's brutal violation of the Minsk agreements, the ceasefire regime and the withdrawal of heavy weaponry\". Mr Poroshenko visited the soldiers who had left Debaltseve in the town of Artemivsk on Wednesday. Earlier, he said it would be an honour to shake hands with \"Ukrainian heroes\". A senior Ukrainian military official said 22 Ukrainian soldiers had died in Debaltseve over the past three days. Earlier, an official at a morgue in Artemivsk said the bodies of 25 Ukrainian soldiers had been brought to the facility from Debaltseve but this has not been confirmed. Rebels have claimed that hundreds of Ukrainian troops were killed in clashes around the city, but Mr Poroshenko denied this. The government in Kiev admitted that that some soldiers were taken prisoner in Debaltseve, but gave no details on how many were seized. All Wednesday, the road out of Debaltseve into government-held territory thundered to the sound of retreating armour - tanks and troop carriers full of exhausted, sometimes defiant soldiers. In a bus by the side of the road, I found one Yuri slumped on his seat, across the aisle from a sleeping colleague. He said the situation had become increasingly dire and individual units had taken their own decisions to leave. They were running out of ammunition and in danger of being surrounded, he told me. He blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for deceiving everyone about the ceasefire. We know him well by now, he said. When he says something is guaranteed, that means there's some kind of trap coming up. In nearby fields, mortars and multiple rocket launchers fired back at the rebels - providing cover for those still trying to leave Debaltseve. President Poroshenko says the withdrawal was planned and organised, but on the ground it looked like a hasty retreat in the face of overwhelming odds. The withdrawal came after Russian President Vladimir Putin urged Ukraine's troops in Debaltseve to surrender. Mr Putin is due to speak by telephone later on Wednesday to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Mr Poroshenko, according to the French government. Spokesman Stephane Le Foll insisted the agreement announced last week by the four leaders to end the fighting in eastern Ukraine was not dead, and that progress had been made. International observers monitoring the truce have been unable to enter Debaltseve. The city has become a key prize for rebels and government forces, as it sits on a strategic railway line linking the rebel-held cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. Most of its 25,000 population has been evacuated but about 7,000 civilians are still believed trapped by the fighting. The ceasefire, which came into effect on Sunday, has been broadly observed elsewhere and some rebel heavy weaponry was said to have been withdrawn. The UN says more than 5,600 people have been killed in the conflict, but there are fears the actual death toll could be much higher. Fighting began in eastern Ukraine in April, a month after Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula.

If we had that, we would know a lot more. \"We wouldn't know the full cause, but we would know half of the reasons at least and we would have learned from it.\" Jim Morris, an aviation law expert with Irwin Mitchell Solicitors, also said the lack of a \"black box\" had hampered the investigation. He said: \"Unfortunately, in my view, due to a lack of a requirement to fit a black box flight data recorder, we have almost more unanswered questions.\" Mr Morris added: \"We still do not know why fuel did not reach the engines. \"The report goes into significant detail in its analysis but it is clear from what is said in the report that they can't answer all the questions.\" Anne-Marie Kennedy, who was working behind the bar and was trapped in the wreckage, said she was \"satisfied\" with how the briefing went. She said: \"It's shown me that they should have black boxes for defo, it's shown me the need for other regulation, but other than that nothing. \"Until I speak to my legal team I can only speculate. \"I'm satisfied with the way the night went. I believe that the AAIB has done everything in their power. \"The guy explained the investigation, the complexity and the length of time. They did all they could.\" Find out more The Police Scotland Eurocopter EC 135, operated by Bond Air Services, came down on to the roof of the Clutha Bar at about 22:25 on a busy Friday night.
