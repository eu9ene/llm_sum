He was responsible for the convictions of 31 concentration camp guards, including camp commander Josef Kramer and Dr Fritz Klein. He never spoke of his experience of the holocaust or his role in the trials, but his family recently discovered a photograph of him watching the execution of the camp commander. He returned to the UK after the war and re-qualified as a solicitor and married, becoming Mayor of Glastonbury in 1969.", "This year marks the one year anniversary of the horrific kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls by the jihadist group Boko Haram in Nigeria. The girls were taken while they were taking a physics exam at their school. Despite the outrage, many of the girls remain missing, and the conflict in Northeastern Nigeria continues to force 800,000 children to flee their homes. Amnesty International reports that women and children are still being abducted and killed, and the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls still continues to spread on social media.", "The Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 had a devastating impact on bird populations in the region, according to new research. A study by the University of South Carolina found that the number of barn swallows had plummeted from hundreds to dozens.

The team are now hoping to learn more from the Chernobyl disaster site in Ukraine.", "English golfer Ian Poulter recently posted a picture of eight acupuncture needles in the back of his neck as he seeks alternative treatments to aid his recovery from sport.

Jesse Webb was eventually caught and given a 12 month term this week.", "Per Mertesacker, Arsenal's vice-captain, has tipped compatriot Jurgen Klopp to make his mark in the Premier League if he chooses to continue his career in England.

An agreement was reached in Lausanne, Switzerland, which if finalized in June, could bring international investors to Iran and boost the nation's economy after years of sanctions. Iranians are divided between moderates and hardliners over the agreement, but Khamenei's approval has been key to reaching the deal, and he hopes to leave a legacy of a diplomatic win for his country.", "William Shatner, of Star Trek fame, has proposed a radical plan to help solve California's ongoing drought disaster: he wants to crowdfund $30 billion to build a pipeline from Seattle to bring water to the state. However, experts have declared the plan as \"highly illogical\" as California and Washington are both in the midst of a severe drought. Shatner is hoping to get the funding through a Kickstarter campaign, and is also open to other ideas on how the money should be spent should the campaign fail.", "Alastair Cook's future as England captain for the upcoming Ashes hangs on the decisions of the new ECB chairman-elect, Colin Graves, and chief executive, Tom Harrison. Cook's run of 33 Test innings without a century has not been easy, and so it is crucial that he hits form in the second Test against West Indies, with the team preparing for a victory.

It is up to Cook to prove his worth and lead by example.", "Jason Holder and Marlon Samuels have done much to inspire their team-mates to the disciplined, character and application culture Phil Simmons is striving to create as the new West Indies coach. Samuels took the difficult road of competing in a Test match, grafted his way to 103, and will take more satisfaction than he ever would in an IPL match. Test cricket gives players a mental and physical challenge that is unparalleled, and it is this sort of effort and commitment that will be remembered even in the modern world.", "Conspiracy theorist Andre Gignac recently claimed to have made a \"stunning discovery\" in a photograph released by Nasa and taken by the Mars rover Opportunity: what appears to be a bunker on the red planet with armed people peering out of its windows. Gignac speculates that the \"massive panoramic window\" he found could be part of a larger bunker, and that near it are structures, missiles and rockets deployed in a circle. While some are fascinated by the idea that people are secretly living beneath the surface of Mars, scientists believe that such sightings may be down to a psychological phenomenon called Pareidolia.", "Shane O'Byrne and wife Jaimie received a parking ticket of \u00a32.20 after the ticket they purchased fell off the dashboard while getting their newborn baby out of the car. Despite trying to explain the situation to the council, the dispute escalated over two years and ended in the couple having to pay a \u00a3400 fine.

The promising results indicate that this vaccine could be a viable treatment for cancer in the future.", "The Green Party has released a humorous election video featuring four party leaders, David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Ed Miliband and Nigel Farage, forming a 'Coalition' boyband singing about austerity, public services and immigration. The video pokes fun at how, despite their claims to the contrary, the four major parties are singing from the same hymn sheet. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett says the video is meant to demonstrate that there is an alternative to 'business-as-usual' politics and voting for the Green Party is a chance for people to break the Westminster consensus.", "Mindy Kaling's brother, Vijay Chokalingam, recently revealed a project of his own, in which he applied to medical school under the guise of being African-American.

His experience highlights the disparities between minority and non-minority applicants, as well as the necessity of affirmative action programs in industries such as health care and Hollywood, where Asian Americans are often vastly underrepresented.", "Researchers from Ghent University and the International Potato Institute have discovered that sweet potatoes contain 'foreign DNA,' making them a form of natural genetically modified organism (GMO). This type of gene exchange across species has been happening for thousands of years, meaning humans have unknowingly been eating GM foods for much longer than they thought. This discovery highlights the fact that genetic modification also occurs in nature, and that in comparison to these natural GMOs, human-made GMOs have the advantage of being controlled by us.", "Mullah Mohammed Omar is still considered the leader of the Taliban according to a biography just published by the militant group. This release appears to be an attempt to put to rest rumors of Omar's death, as well as to remind the world of his jihadi leadership credentials in light of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's claim to be \"caliph\" of the world's Muslims. Born in 1960 in Kandahar, Omar led rebel groups in fighting against the Soviet invasion before his movement captured Kabul and imposed Islamic law throughout Afghanistan until their ousting in 2001.", "Helen Dunn, 78, was shocked to discover a photo of herself as a pin-up girl in a vintage lads' magazine from 1955, when she opened the Sunday Mercury newspaper.

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has called the former Prime Minister a \"megalomaniac\" for the remarks, in which Blair also announced plans to remain actively involved in politics and business in his 90s. He claims he needs to stay active for fear of becoming bored. These comments, coupled with praise for an authoritarian military regime in Egypt, have prompted criticism of his ambitions.", "Scooter's Coffee in Omaha had their Facebook page hacked and flooded with inappropriate content, including adult cartoons, after an employee clicked on a malicious link in an email.

Police have increased patrols and have appealed for witnesses, as well as community support, to find those responsible.", "Dove's latest ad campaign takes a more brutal approach by asking a group of women to write down their insecurities in a notebook. Unbeknownst to them, these insecurities were turned into a script, which two actresses then read in a cafe.

Dove hopes to encourage women to be kinder to themselves and each other, and to focus on their beauty instead of insecurities.", "Christian Benteke rescued a point for Aston Villa with a stunning hat-trick against Queens Park Rangers on Saturday.
