If the 60 daddy days aren't used, they are lost, reducing the maximum leave to 420 days. Sweden also created a \"gender equality bonus\": the more days that parents share the leave equally, they get a bonus that could total up to 1,500 euros, or $1,649. The idea is for both parents to share the joys and struggles of raising infants, but in reality, only 12% of Swedish couples equally share the 480 days of leave. The fathers have become more understanding of their wives and even their own mothers, and some are now considering a career change to accommodate their parenthood.

The size 14 beauty lived with a group of standard 'skinnier' models during her stint working in New York, and says that their agents instructed them to stick to a diet of 'one cracker and a couple of glasses of water'. The measures taken by the model roommates are extreme and unhealthy, not only for their body but mentally as well. Laura's comments come days after France passed legislation banning excessively thin models from participating in Paris Fashion Week. Agents and fashion houses that hire them could also face fines under the new law, which was passed on April 3.", "Raheem Sterling is caught on camera smoking a shisha pipe, which is a popular fad among young people.

The treatment known as kriotherapy (or cryotherapy) involves exposing the body to freezing temperatures of -200C for between 1-3minutes to assist muscle recovery. Kriotherapy has also been used by the Wales rugby union team as well as Tottenham players including Andros Townsend, Christian Eriksen and Jan Vertonghen - while Real Madrid superstar has had his own 'ice chamber' installed at home. Head of sports science at Manchester City (and formerly with Spurs), Dr Sam Erith, has said: 'Kriotherapy means you can train more, to get fitter more quickly.

He has defied the West in the face of increasing economic pressure. Iran claims that its program is peaceful, but Khamenei's refusal to end uranium enrichment activities -- a process that can lead to making nuclear fuel as well as nuclear bombs -- has landed the country under crippling sanctions. The standoff with the West has stretched longer than the war. The agreement reached in Lausanne, Switzerland, however, marks a new chapter in the history of the country.

Upon facing graduation and exploring his med school options, he realized that fellow Indian-Americans with his grades were getting turned down from the universities of his choice, but that \"black, Hispanic, and Native American applicants with my grades and test scores were much more likely to gain acceptance.\" This revelation led him to make the decision to pose as a black man, both to \"dramatically improve\" his chances of admission, and to illustrate the unfair advantage that blacks and other underrepresented minorities receive when applying to prestigious schools. To accomplish this goal, Chokalingam shaved his head of its naturally wavy black locks, trimmed his \"long Indian-American eyelashes,\" checked \"black\" under the optional race/ethnicity declaration and submitted his application to 14 schools under his childhood nickname \"JoJo.\" He", "The article discusses how sweet potatoes have been found to contain 'foreign DNA' that has been transferred from bacteria.
